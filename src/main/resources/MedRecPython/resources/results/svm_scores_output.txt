PROCEDURES: 1.713662192e+53 1
1. Trach tube change - the patient's tracheostomy tube was -77908583.4896 0
changed to a Custom #6 Bivona on 6/17/05 by Dr. Klatt ( Surgery ). 80218.3661131 1
2. Bronchoscopy - A bronchoscopy was performed on 7/4/05 and -1.25533365188e+11 0
revealed erythematous soft tissue in the posterior pharynx , -1.69379237935e+14 0
compromising the airway above the trach tube. Granulation tissue -2.6333254992e+16 0
was noted above the site of the trach tube that also appeared to -10093395.7767 0
potentially compromise the airway. -2.57817585677e+16 0
3. Modified barium swallow - modified barium swallow was -1.30779117965e+12 0
performed on 6/17/05 , which revealed a moderate aspiration risk. -57864098651.4 0
The patient was recommended for a mechanical soft diet. -3459653623.43 0
HOSPITAL COURSE: -5.09951906026e+24 0
1. Trach change: On admission , the patient was admitted to the -3835479.3144 0
General Medical Service for problems with her trach tube. Over -4.86765519967e+11 0
the course of this admission , her trach tube did become dislodged -1351340763.26 0
on numerous occasions. During these times , either surgery or -3.8658614454e+11 0
respiratory therapy were required to reinsert the trach tube. -8.02725493565e+11 0
However , the patient remained stable throughout these events with -7.04782160393e+13 0
a pulse oximetry reading greater than 92% , even when the 392575.289053 1
tube became dislodged. The patient required a Custom fit #6 -448870390.762 0
Bivona cuffless trach tube. Dr. Avellano ( General Surgery ) inserted this tube -1.3244223015e+11 0
without incident. Initially , the patient did feel some irritation once the -1.11675590901e+12 0
tube was inserted , however , this resolved with deep suctioning and nebulizer -72571449477.5 0
therapy. Once inserted , the new trach tube fit well and the -14857733.5045 0
patient was comfortable , with oxygen saturations greater than 92% -1.57051276269e+11 0
on trach mask oxygen. 445430.7781 1
2. Redundant oropharyngeal tissue: During this admission , the -2.32471890491e+12 0
patient underwent a bronchoscopy to evaluate for possibile -2.42864128756e+17 0
decannulation. However , this procedure revealed -1.49646511717e+22 0
excessive tissue in her upper oropharynx and -4.37593945291e+12 0
what appeared to be edematous tissue in the airway. The significance of this -1530669264.09 0
finding was uncertain , although it was felt that this tissue could -1778688478.64 0
compromise the airway if her trach tube was removed. Therefore , 10025322321.2 1
the patient should not be decannulated without repeat evaluation of her -1.03428869655e+13 0
upper airway. Throughout this hospital -9.52153286497e+19 0
course , the patient had her trach tube in place. She was able to -5738.27866663 0
use a Passey-Muir valve for speaking and she may continue to use -327420747.404 0
one with her trach tube in place. 164249.134839 1
3. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of -2718875344.95 0
recurrent pneumonia and poor pulmonary function , the patient -9.37832813731e+14 0
underwent a modified barium swallow evaluation for possible -1.36448862592e+18 0
aspiration pneumonia. She was found to have some difficulty -4.92060368811e+13 0
during this evaluation , and Speech and Swallow recommended the -3.86427497076e+12 0
patient continue a mechanical soft diet without fluid -1.30312175082e+14 0
restrictions indefinitely. During this hospital course , the -7.54220560964e+18 0
patient had been on tube feeds through her G tube , although these -7750599.41279 0
may be tapered once the patient is tolerating oral food well. -71222399.6538 0
COMPLICATIONS: None. 448840530.528 1
CONSULTANTS: Dr. August Adkinson , General Surgery. 9595563731.51 1

He was diuresed intermittently very gently with IV Lasix at 20 , 209502871.837 1
which seemed to improve the patient's shortness of breath and -5440179908.01 0
wheezing , which correlated with the patient being more wet. He -8261990408.68 0
was restarted on his own Lasix of 60 , for which he should 406873.786249 1
continue and also recommend having the patient receive daily -2.14936214249e+14 0
weight checks and to adjust Lasix in order to maintain daily 556883672.553 1
weight. 423000.536183 1
Rhythm: The patient is afib with left bundle-branch block 20136455223.8 1
occasionally and RVR at Ening Health , which seemed to -583391010.067 0
correlate with fevers. But , he had a normal rate while inhouse -109065559.106 0
especially while on beta-blocker. He has an AICD , which seemed -8081168563.89 0
to be working fine inhouse as well as a pacemaker. 344866.028979 1
2. Pulmonary: The patient has maintained on 2 to 3 liters at 731254.659517 1
which he is saturating at 93% to a 100%. He will likely need 61.82453423 1
oxygen for a few more days as some of his remaining fluid is 52066.577416 1
taken off. Please check oxygen saturations daily and titrate off -9.53905594337e+12 0
oxygen as he is able to. 410.570822721 1
3. Renal: The patient is with chronic renal insufficiency , -675389719.311 0
baseline of 1.7. His range in the hospital was 1.7 to 2.5. 528418.520854 1

any urine Eos or caths to suggest allergic interstitial nephritis -2.86026887092e+13 0
or ATN. Please repeat a creatinine in one week to ensure that it 1537651.16007 1
remains stable. I suspect that as some of his fluid is taken -9775206.74539 0
off , his flow will be better and his creatinine will be slightly -2159782.25808 0
improved. -458038623.539 0
4. Endo: The patient is with diabetes. He was initially on 1529343.39855 1
Portland protocol while in the Intensive Care Unit. On the -12326703405.1 0
floor , he was maintained on NPH and a Regular Insulin sliding -44079278.5354 0
scale. He should continue on NPH and this should be titrated in -152983373.522 0
order to maximize blood sugar control , so he should continue on a -9167287.97909 0
Regular Insulin sliding scale. Once the patient is ready for -52164020014.8 0
discharge to home , he should be switched back to his oral 1643189.54251 1
hypoglycemics. -8.72105982317e+20 0
5. Heme: We held the patient's Coumadin or anticoagulation as 97495471.807 1
it is contraindicated in the setting of endocarditis. Now that -4.85581628004e+11 0
his sepsis seems to resolve , the patient should be restarted on -273784895.632 0
his Coumadin in approximately 3 to 4 days after discharge with a 155911098.639 1
goal of an INR of 2 to 3. 106.517637192 1
6. Psyche: The patient remained generally oriented to person -2.24394391004e+11 0
and situation to hospital while inhouse , but occasionally slide -9.93413412258e+12 0
down especially in the setting of having fevers. He was -1145724182.8 0
continued on his home Zoloft and we added a small dose of 653910.791562 1
Zyprexa , which seemed to also help. The patient benefits from 495957373.653 1
regular reorientation which we suggest continuing. -5.50576228487e+17 0
7. Prophylaxis: The patient is to receive heparin t.i.d. and 91568379.3549 1
PPI for DVT and ulcer prophylaxis respectively. -88741089412.1 0

fibrillation it was felt that it would be necessary to hospitalize -68462705900.3 0
her , hold her Coumadin and heparinize her until it was possible to 138146652.226 1
do her surgery. However , upon arrival here her admission INR was -143450275.373 0
noted to be subtherapeutic at 1.3 and she was , therefore , -1284971.97028 0
immediately started on heparin. The Cardiology Service was -8.51527199421e+16 0
consulted regarding her significant past cardiac history and -6.60977460668e+18 0
recommended an echocardiogram to be performed preoperatively. This -1.75427512764e+23 0
echo was done on 8/20/98 demonstrating an EF of 55% with an -139413.849983 0
abnormal subdural wall motion , trace areas of aortic insufficiency -2.52023782646e+14 0
and mildly increased right ventricular size and the artificial -3.68971509873e+15 0
mitral valve was noted to be functioning well. The cardiology felt -1.28309773029e+11 0
that in the face of this largely unchanged echocardiogram that -6.91840201922e+11 0
showed stable and should go to the operating room for repair of -139624430.412 0
umbilical hernia. On 4/15/98 the patient was taken to the -3149827977.44 0
operating room and underwent umbilical hernia repair with primary -1.18175057492e+17 0
reapproximation of the fascia. The procedure was done without any -2.18919911427e+13 0
complications. She was extubated and transferred in stable -2.87498008643e+17 0
condition to the postoperative recovery area and observed on the -8.75211398357e+12 0
floor. She was immediately restarted on her Coumadin as well as 18355803709.9 1
her heparin which she continued for the next three days -751045703.298 0
postoperatively. The patient did quite well with gradual up in her -62348983520.1 0
INR to a greater than 2 level and she was discharged to home on 175512.273387 1
7/26/98 on a regular dose. 442696.754356 1

Her temperature was 99 , her pulse was 98 , her blood pressure was 822062.335149 1
105/55. Her respiratory rate was 18 when she was saturating 94% -156835320.521 0
on room air. In general , she is in no acute distress. Her HEENT 570460.409643 1
exam was unremarkable. Her cardiac exam was regular rate and -1.09382718951e+11 0
rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Her lung exam was -681472.443116 0
notable for crackles most prominent in the left lower lobe. Her -6982629149.0 0
abdomen was soft , obese , nontender and nondistended with good -8374646847.31 0
bowel sounds. Her extremities were significant for erythema of -1.85519966174e+15 0
the left shin without warmth or tenderness. She also had a small -402468712.925 0
1.5 cm ulceration on the bottom of her left foot which has been -1397586.52678 0
present for sometime although she says that it looks better than -11980580751.5 0

Cardiac catheterization: it was done by Dr. Eeds . 69317963.0155 1
FINDINGS: -4.21329504936e+35 0
Showed a right dominant circulation. There were no significant -2.79113885716e+15 0
left main lesions identified. The LAD had a tubular 90% lesion -97782862.7748 0
and the diagonal I had a proximal tubular 60% lesion , there was -312034.31321 0
also a diffuse 80% lesion of the proximal circumflex. The RCA -17819679.0774 0
had a proximal 75% lesion with a mid diffuse 60% lesion and a PLV 37043.6393506 1
tubular 70% lesion. The coronary artery bypass grafts had a -135068402.231 0
patent LIMA to LAD graft , the SVG to marginal I had a 100% lesion 44557.8190206 1
during this catheterization due to the moderate amount of -1.42695343413e+12 0
contrast and the patient's chronic kidney disease , they treated -46342140687.5 0
the RCA and placed a 3 x 24 mm Taxus stent 6083.03887544 1
ECHOCARDIOGRAM: -4.96864470127e+97 0
On 11/0/07 , showed an estimated ejection fraction of 50% with -86618570.0978 0
inferoseptal and inferior severe hypokinesis. The RV was normal. -2.81188120714e+13 0
There was mild aortic stenosis. Mild-to-moderate aortic -1.28127713557e+21 0
regurgitation. The valve area was 1.2 cm2. There was mild -7627026564.47 0

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: -5.23582526475e+15 0
1. Cardiovascular: -1.67746887483e+31 0
a. Ischemia: The patient was admitted because they had deep T -74418332.8399 0
wave inversions in the lateral leads and are still concerning for -47581907381.2 0
anginal equivalence of nausea and vomiting. It was decided on -3.59497466567e+11 0
admission that an echocardiogram would be performed and if there -8.33093704866e+12 0
was evidence of any regional wall motion abnormalities that she -2.1807948638e+12 0
would be taken directly to cath. The echocardiogram as noted 20934668789.8 1
above showed inferior hypokinesis consistent with coronary artery -4.61493121056e+22 0
disease. She was taken to the cath lab on 11/2/07 and they show 2477486.71206 1
two ____ that one of the bypass grafts was completely occluded -2377465505.34 0
and was not visualized. They also saw that there was a proximal -158376082.612 0
RCA lesion 60% which was found to account for the inferior -7082566.88123 0
hypokinesis given the right arm circulation. This was stented -6.23087481905e+14 0
with a Taxus stent. Because of her kidney insufficiency , it was -105442895.778 0
decided not to pursue the 80% left circ lesion and this was -355014.494647 0
deferred until later point as this was not thought to be causing -289261089.731 0
any problems. Her post cath ECG was unchanged and continued to 455849424.72 1
have the deep lateral T wave inversions. She did not complain of -259917281.034 0
any chest pain or nausea and vomiting during her admission. She -11598131071.9 0
was started on aspirin and Plavix initially although as noted -48008967446.4 0
below she did have an apparent allergy to Plavix and thus was -4928652.92958 0
switched to ticlopidine 250 mg b.i.d. instead of Plavix for 71071191189.5 1
anticoagulation. She was also continued Lipitor 80 mg daily , -59370882959.1 0
Lopressor 25 mg t.i.d. After her cath , it was originally planned 682434908.749 1
that she would go back to cath for intervention on the left 6123877.29939 1
circulation lesion , however , given her other medical problems and -2.43082902282e+11 0
her relative stability hemodynamically and symptomatically , it -7.05439276319e+20 0
was decided that they would wait and decide later if this lesion -334358199.73 0
needed to be corrected in the future or not. -145358.95681 0
b. Pump: The patient had no significant issues with her blood -58003667.694 0
pressure here. She remained in a blood pressure range of 100-120 -9267483582.85 0
throughout her stay. She was continued on her beta blocker as -864509656.691 0
noted above. However , at discharge , this was switched back to -114285747.038 0
atenolol as her home medications and she refused to change -5098173869.57 0
medications , she said that she would not be able to afford new 158285.707405 1
prescription. We did increase her dose of atenolol to 25 mg 311035167.225 1
b.i.d. from 25 mg daily as her requirement of beta blockade 231233905.482 1
seemed to be higher than what her home dose was. Given that she 1847317.08236 1
has a concurrent renal disease , it would probably be useful for -230104362.127 0
her to be on an ace inhibitor ARB as well. This medication 2778998.92139 1
should be added as an outpatient , if her blood pressure tolerates -1022526543.43 0
it. It was on the lower side here , so we did not add it. We did -207.924250193 0
not diurese her in fact we held her Lasix on admission because 3479864.92271 1
she seemed to be volume depleted given that she was admitted with -561164577.733 0
a lot of diarrhea , this again will need to be reconsidered if she -252043.930842 0
had increased edema. This can be restarted. -2016098181.98 0
C: Rhythm: The patient was kept on telemetry , however , there 426328.735674 1
were no significant episodes of arrhythmias during her admission. -6.45633746195e+13 0
2. GI: The patient was admitted with persistent nausea and -452212939.49 0
diarrhea from Tlmamuthes Medical Center .  The diarrhea resolved one day -1.20518849007e+13 0
after admission. Her fecal leukocytes were positive but her C. -7240292312.37 0
diff was negative. It was unclear what the etiology of this -395062947.099 0
diarrhea was and we were going to send a repeat stool study , -949871.084751 0
however , she did not have any diarrhea afterwards and this may be -33349534.5894 0
antibiotics associated diarrhea but it seemed to resolve -1.29224807445e+16 0
spontaneously. -2.25014996565e+20 0
3. Pulmonary: The patient was admitted with crackles in the -924277415.26 0
left lower lobe and some wheezing consistent with COPD and -29393889960.4 0
pneumonia. A chest x-ray on admission showed a right lower lobe -7516514007.21 0
infiltrate/atelectasis. We initially continued her on Augmentin , -2.77542329215e+22 0
which she was taking for her diabetic foot ulcer. However , she -101068552.138 0
did not appear to clinically respond to this medication. We held -16081545851.1 0
her antibiotics as noted below in the ID section and after that -151010856.3 0
her white blood cell count increased and she produced some -22418226906.1 0
purulent sputum and Gram-negative rods. The Gram-negative rods -3.42348161314e+20 0
were later speciated as serratia although this information is not -1.97696562213e+13 0
available at the time of her discharge. She was treated for a -33718510.4852 0
hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftazidime to -2.96701308467e+27 0
complete a 14-day course. Clinically , she appeared to improve on -24923193982.1 0
this regimen , although her white count was still elevated at 15 -195409555.053 0
on discharge , however , given her overall clinical stability , the -1740945588.29 0
lack of fevers and the lack of systemic symptoms. We felt 3754346.39976 1
comfortable with discharging her with close follow up. -2.37879660799e+11 0
4. Infectious disease: The patient was initially admitted on -1.79214808755e+11 0
Augmentin for a diabetic foot ulcer , the notes from Grantnas Healthcare by the Infectious Disease Service recommended a 2-4 week -2.34962193554e+11 0
course of Augmentin for her diabetic foot ulcer. She had -452785899.949 0
completed three weeks of therapy and thus we discontinued this -9.21876891717e+11 0
medication as it did not seem that there was really any evidence -228965801.566 0
of active infection in her foot. After holding the antibiotics -6.41450752708e+11 0
for three days , her white count began to rise and she developed a 18132.0297004 1
purulent cough as noted above , this was thought to be a -806081.422596 0
hospital-acquired pneumonia. She was treated with vancomycin and -5.70633262446e+21 0
ceftazidime and she will complete a 14-day course of these -15325579565.8 0
antibiotics. -1.95473213753e+15 0

HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for possible porphyria -4.98455310288e+14 0
attack versus Ativan withdrawal symptoms versus -1.69936647248e+21 0
anxiety attack. Neurology consultation was obtained who felt that -7.91942933869e+16 0
patient's peripheral neuropathy was probably secondary to -1.99971899034e+17 0
longstanding diabetes but felt that some of her symptomatology -2.95661502619e+15 0
could be consistent with porphyria. Patient was also seen by -80776525098.3 0
Psychiatry who felt that this episode was consistent with -2.89225963634e+12 0
generalized anxiety disorder separated by post dysthymia and -5.33701671665e+18 0
suggested phenothiazines which are proven to be safe in porphyria -2.20157347911e+13 0
for treatment. She was started on Trilafon 2 to 4 mg p.o. p.r.n. 2005911.31371 1
q.6h. for anxiety. The patient was also seen to be orthostatic -2833556117.38 0
which was felt to be secondary to dehydration secondary to poor -4723599558.61 0
p.o. intake prior to admission. She was also hyperglycemic on -1.16879487204e+11 0
admission which may have contributed to her dehydration. She was -6.60136730733e+12 0
treated with normal saline boluses and her orthostasis improved. -2.5245059363e+13 0
Her Lopressor was also held with this episode of orthostasis. The -33184405609.2 0
Watson-Schwartz test done by Dr. Mohar on patient very early in the admission -17467836361.1 0
was negative which made an acute porphyria attack very -64808237388.4 0
unlikely. These episodes were felt to be secondary to a -1572362378.57 0
combination of anxiety attack and rapid taper of Ativan which she 31060870654.2 1
had been taking at moderately high doses for the last two months. -23077274.1327 0
Patient also developed urinary tract infection symptoms and her -8.85554113348e+15 0

In summary , this is a 60-year-old morbidly obese woman who -430775262.03 0
presented with acute and chronic renal failure and anemia. -60801782067.6 0
PROBLEM: -8.79280149212e+27 0
1. Renal: Renal failure initially thought to be secondary to -1061915256.12 0
prerenal etiology in the setting of elevated BUN/creatinine ratio -1.39643509103e+17 0
and FENA less than 1% in the setting of Lasix and FEBUN of 19% 19069.7514747 1
and because of the presence of abundant granular casts. ATN also -16669480562.2 0
possibility but urine sodium was 29. Postrenal etiology was -6.4219389523e+13 0
ruled out with a renal ultrasound without evidence of -28113400406.0 0
hydronephrosis. The patient was aggressively hydrated once -4.49079609859e+23 0
outside hospital records confirmed an ejection fraction of 60%. -28499765989.0 0
However , the patient initially appeared to fail volume challenge -1.98275575061e+13 0
with no acute change in creatinine past 3.2 from 2/16/05 to -229896196.03 0
7/26/05. At that time , Vascular Surgery was consulted for AV -1413276803.03 0
fistula placement in the setting of GFR of approximately 17 that 815687615.37 1
was not improving. AV fistula was placed on 1/29/05 in the left 18666824.5898 1
arm without complication. Renal function was waxing and waning -2.58425896856e+15 0
throughout hospital course with creatinine at time of discharge -7.06155639797e+15 0
of 3.1. Daily urine output usually approximately 600-700 mL. -2.03869891271e+11 0
All diuretics and ACE inhibitor was held throughout hospital -1.99217717675e+14 0
course and blood pressure well controlled. The patient should -9.0200669109e+14 0
not be restarted on these medications because it will precipitate -2.12024502457e+13 0
worsening kidney failure. -1.0911602115e+14 0
2. GI: Colonoscopy in 2001/2003 notable for diverticula. Stool -1.84447849108e+12 0
was guaiac throughout hospital course and generally guaiac -2.961267018e+17 0
positive brown stool. Hematocrit did not bump appropriately -8.75836769849e+17 0
after transfusion of 4 units. It went from 23.3-30. GI was 17383154.9389 1
consulted in this setting and plans were made for EGD and -143578006.175 0
colonoscopy to look for a source of GI bleed. Both procedures -585070139.801 0
were scheduled in OR and attempted on 5/3/05. EGD successfully -1.04991914599e+12 0

peripancreatic stranding , and there was stones seen in the -46727840589.5 0
gallbladder; however , there was no common bile duct dilatation -12631056999.6 0
and no pseudocyst or evidence of necrosis in the pancreas. -348772383.118 0
ASSESSMENT: This is a 70-year-old woman with a history of -265792816.485 0
hypertension who presented with acute abdominal pain and an -5.73634257901e+13 0
abdominal CT consistent with pancreatitis with gallstones in the -3.24536816354e+16 0
gallbladder , but without evidence of obstruction. -9.0400932148e+12 0
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: -5.23582526475e+15 0
1. GI: Pancreatitis diagnosed by clinical picture. Laboratory -1.78275393652e+15 0
values on CT findings on admission with no evidence of pseudocyst -17287191870.9 0
or necrosis or other surgical complications of pancreatitis. -9.12488438338e+14 0
Though likely etiology for pancreatitis was gallstone given that -3.14714279398e+16 0
there were gallstones seen on her abdominal CT and that she had -114857259.835 0
elevation of some of her LFTs. She did go on to have a right 12993.6739031 1
upper quadrant ultrasound to reevaluate. The common bile duct -6.50265738486e+14 0
looked not dilated , but right at the upper limits of normal. -223526.705262 0
Given this borderline values she was also sent for MRCP to rule -114285747.038 0
out CBD dilatation in the event that she may need cholecystectomy -29356005569.3 0
in the future. The MRCP showed again no evidence of obstruction -7536491058.68 0
of the duct and no evidence of cholecystitis. She was treated -2635681115.32 0
with aggressive IV fluid hydration for the first several days of -13337580992.3 0
admission. Pain controlled with morphine , and was kept n.p.o. -9917750064.94 0
for several days until her pain improved. At this time , her IV 3513967.94118 1
fluids were gradually decreased , and her diet was gradually -1.40274794037e+11 0
advanced as tolerated. By the time of discharge , she was -50008411.1824 0
tolerating a regular diet without any recurrence of her abdominal -2.04081657674e+13 0
pain , nausea , or vomiting , and was not requiring any further pain -3251647.94896 0
medication. Her LFTs , amylase , and lipase normalized within a 4367641103.6 1
few days of treatment early in the hospitalization. She was also -12631056999.6 0
maintained on IV b.i.d. H2 blocker , and then discharged to home 119107333.395 1
on p.o. Pepcid. Given her stated history of heartburn. She was 6274210832.82 1
given an appointment to follow up with the TH General Surgery -1980149683.7 0
Clinic for evaluation for likely cholecystectomy and instructed -1.13045582556e+21 0
that this would be her plan of care after discharge. -369128.010678 0
2. Cardiovascular. In terms of ischemia , the patient did have -2822066259.23 0
some T-wave flattening diffusely on her EKG; however , had no -55823034.8821 0
chest pain. This is likely related to her hypokalemia on -1667847922.25 0
presentation. She did rule out for an MI with 3 sets of negative 1320795.74939 1
enzymes and had no EKG changes or telemetry changes concerning -1.58227650558e+12 0
for ischemia and no bouts of chest pain throughout her admission. -740166426.306 0
In terms of pump , she was aggressively fluid rehydrated , given -204473268.002 0
her dehydration on admission , and her diagnosis of pancreatitis , -91894951111.0 0
but did not have any signs of fluid overload at any point during -7161137.67258 0
her hospitalization , and was returned to all p.o. diet without -7550283765.44 0
need for IV fluids prior to discharge. Her blood pressure was -238218821.56 0
well controlled originally with her home medication of Norvasc -5.19043581552e+14 0
and then with a change to Lopressor in order to obtain good rate -859582.751439 0
control as well without bouts of hypertension throughout this -6.48895399089e+14 0
admission. In terms of rhythm , the patient did have some -91154449.7184 0
episodes of likely atrial fibrillation versus multifocal atrial -1.73393453925e+21 0
tachycardia on telemetry early in her admission. These episodes -5.87969407797e+15 0
would last only a few seconds and resolved spontaneously and the -26130709724.8 0
patient did not have symptoms from these. This was thought to be -292905280.974 0
likely related to her acute illness and her hypokalemia on -16820781201.3 0
admission. However , she was started on Lopressor for better rate -27520926878.2 0
control , which was up titrated as needed with good effect. By -60758444.484 0
the time of discharge , she had had no events on telemetry for -255186.805518 0
greater than 36 hours. She was discharged on new medication of -2437171275.01 0
Toprol to control her rate and also taking the place of her 4752172.77502 1
Norvasc for her blood pressure control. 24694840903.2 1
3. ID. The patient did have a low-grade temperature on -510666735.457 0
admission , but this was likely related to her inflammation. -2072963702.98 0
Blood cultures x2 drawn at the time of admission were negative. -96003481.748 0
The chest x-ray was negative for any growth and finalized before -23584006786.8 0
discharge. Chest x-ray was negative for any evidence of -2.91842790011e+11 0
pneumonia and a urinalysis was negative. She was not started on -11441722058.6 0
any antibiotics throughout the admission. -2.35524571314e+16 0
4. Hematology. The patient has underlying anemia with an -1.08550364472e+12 0
unclear baseline hematocrit given her infrequent labs at this -6.18460667209e+14 0
institution. Her hematocrit was stable between 31 and 36 -1.34816224092e+12 0
throughout her hospitalization here and recommended that she -4.22540300859e+18 0
follows up with her primary care provider for further -22207672521.4 0
instructions on her anemia. -1680315883.43 0
5. Fluids , electrolytes , nutrition. The patient was initially -2.06430348175e+12 0
aggressively fluid rehydrated and then changed to maintenance IV -3.8353822162e+16 0
fluids. Thus , her diet was advanced. Potassium and magnesium -1.26280260542e+11 0
were repeated as needed with electrolytes originally checked -5.28448092907e+18 0
twice per day until stabilized. She was originally maintained -4.88827051307e+14 0
n.p.o. and then her diet was gradually advanced as her symptoms -8706453826.38 0
tolerated to a house diet before discharge. -1314015909.12 0
6. Prophylaxis. The patient was maintained on IV b.i.d. , Pepcid 54975897291.5 1
for GI prophylaxis , and Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. 1134958888.17 1
7. Code status. The patient is DNR/DNI. 22971040.8053 1
DISCHARGE PLAN: The patient is discharged to home with a -91154449.7184 0
visiting nurse to check in on her for medication management , -1030128628.94 0
nutrition , and home safety evaluation. She has followup -1.50802474084e+12 0
appointments with her primary care provider , Dr. Gahring , and -4389568937.89 0
also with the FNH General Surgery Clinic regarding possible -4.68571661997e+13 0
cholecystectomy. She was instructed not to take her Norvasc any 6.30965843464e+11 1
more and to take instead the Toprol. Also , she was instructed to -5344023.55565 0

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to this hospital with a -1546442658.73 0
recent episode of flash pulmonary edema. When -2.11891235244e+13 0
this had happened previously , cardiac catheterization had revealed -1.98186952883e+18 0
an occluded left circumflex lesion that was stented. There were , -27536547553.5 0
therefore , concerns that the patient may have re-occlusion either -7.92841422986e+13 0
of the stent or of one of her other vessels. Her metformin was 3772056.92636 1
held. She was given pre-cath hydration fluids , and then she -664518057.088 0
underwent cardiac catheterization. The results of this study were -6.40594538212e+16 0
as follows: The patient had a 40% ostial LAD lesion and an 80% mid 18790.4735999 1
D1 lesion , both of which showed no change from her prior -628621.884594 0
catheterization. The patient left circumflex stent was widely -1.55201861468e+19 0
patent. The patient's RCA was noted to be occluded and was filling -101314367.624 0
with collaterals from left to right. At the time of the -10098735.9446 0
catheterization , the patient's renal arteries are also evaluated. -54727135559.7 0
There was a question of an ostial left renal artery stenosis. -71921137.2515 0
However , no other renal disease was noted. -6765669.45955 0
Because the patient's catheterization was unchanged from a prior -1.4920999289e+13 0
study , it was unclear as to the significance of her D1 lesion. For 1519401.65393 1
this reason , the patient underwent an ETT MIBI , the results of -7034781.9695 0
which are as follows: The patient underwent a modified Bruce , -203940030.049 0
heart rate of 66% of maximum predicted heart rate. She exercised 92394077.9939 1
for 4 minutes 30 seconds and stopped secondary to dyspnea. She had -910350850.454 0
no new EKG changes and no chest pain. The MIBI portion of the test 263711.793636 1
showed a nontransmural anterior and inferior MI , with peri-infarct -2.79290210737e+14 0
ischemia involving 3-5 segments. At the time of this dictation , it -2027195233.54 0
is felt that the patient's CAD is an unlikely explanation for her -28573395.1448 0
presentation. Dr. Dibernardo will review the MIBI results and decide -8.62205586615e+14 0
whether a repeat catheterization with PCI is warranted. The most -3.623783603e+12 0
likely explanation is that the patient has diastolic dysfunction -3.56981624268e+16 0
given her age and history of diabetes. Dr. Hake is interested in -194648008.035 0
enrolling her in a study that evaluates angiotensin receptor -1.92519726619e+14 0
blockers in treatment of this disorder. -8068464608.98 0
The patient had an echo during this hospitalization. The left -2.80772032748e+11 0
ventricle is mildly dilated with an EF of 50%. The patient has -3827.01152659 0
apical , septal , and lateral hypokinesis. Her right ventricle size -2.63268303173e+11 0
and function is normal. The patient also has a dilated left atrium -1402717977.32 0
with mild mitral regurgitation. -2.0973268806e+13 0
DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP: She is to follow-up with her primary care -4678739718.58 0
physician in two weeks and her primary -1134416761.42 0
cardiologist in four weeks. -1680315883.43 0
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable condition. -4.11050113328e+11 0
DISCHARGE DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to home. -89837844254.0 0

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medical Service -40888518450.1 0
for management and evaluation of his angina. He -32692214933.2 0
underwent cardiac catheterization on November , 1997 , demonstrating -2.58148985987e+18 0
90% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis , 99% diagonal -6828635215.45 0
one ostial stenosis; circumflex was okay. The right coronary -1.99809864027e+11 0
artery had a mid stenosis of 50%. The patient arrived in the 32650.7353869 1
Catheterization Lab with mild angina on 200 micrograms per minute -1.12214991857e+13 0
of intravenous nitroglycerin. Post catheterization , the patient -5.342971135e+21 0
developed 5/10 chest pain with an increasing pulmonary capillary -2.79294771015e+16 0
wedge pressure to 40 and D-waves of 52. Increasing the -414457329.76 0
nitroglycerin led to resolution of these changes. The patient had -1.32425017235e+13 0
intra-aortic balloon pump placed via the right femoral artery with -6.96916819877e+13 0
return of the wedge to approximately a mean of 6 and his pain was 346097.826615 1
relieved. The patient returned to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit -2.77145929704e+13 0
where he underwent aggressive heart rate and blood pressure -5.78115394223e+13 0
control. He was evaluated by Cardiac Surgery and taken to the -2386413617.82 0
Operating Room on March , 1997 , for coronary artery bypass -86447432.4095 0
grafting times three as described above. The patient was -1.04669445568e+12 0
transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. Electrocardiogram -6.40974761707e+22 0
remained unchanged. He was extubated without difficulty. The -5.45908533333e+18 0
intra-aortic balloon pump was removed. The patient was noted to -2.65810146127e+12 0
have slight confusion on postoperative day number one and two. -8523163266.72 0
Lopressor was restarted and the patient was gently diuresed. His -9.91115333324e+12 0
chest tubes were discontinued. On postoperative day number three , -7.05429961177e+13 0
the patient was noted to be slightly more confused with left facial -1910702275.1 0
droop and aphasia that resolved with mild left lid lag in the early -55468801.4948 0
afternoon. The patient was evaluated by Neurology. A head CT scan -43589759560.9 0
was performed , demonstrating no hemorrhage or acute stroke. There -8.60465533128e+13 0
was a small left cerebellar hemisphere lesion that was believed to -66939340150.1 0
be consistent with a lesion that was greater than 24 hours old. -8282531.2959 0
The patient , however , became progressively encephalopathic. The -1.07689903614e+17 0
patient underwent an echocardiogram and carotid studies , which -1.22792024712e+16 0
demonstrated no evidence of embolic source. The patient's -1.2903741438e+13 0
expressive aphasia and facial weakness , however , recurred. The -8.76650933887e+12 0
patient again underwent head CT scan , demonstrating acute right -6.68585306969e+12 0
parietal infarction that appeared cortically based. Given the -4.11267880046e+19 0
recent intra-aortic balloon pump placement , the aorta could not be -1.73003557645e+11 0
ruled out as a source for embolus. Therefore , heparin was started , 1212570.74156 1
as was Coumadin. The goal INR is 2 to 3. Also the patient had a 30160.2514203 1
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , and although had no -2.467281055e+12 0
evidence of atrial fibrillation , there was concern over potential -6.04370282125e+13 0
cardiac source for embolization. The patient's aphasia and left -9.7229693421e+12 0
facial droop improved steadily. He was evaluated by the Speech and -1.30067216646e+11 0
Swallowing Service. He had no difficulty with swallowing; however , -5.02079870752e+11 0
it was felt that he would benefit from language therapy in addition -1636358649.96 0
to his physical therapy and occupational therapy. The remainder of -8.59513301717e+13 0
the patient's course was uncomplicated from a cardiac standpoint. -2.01684206784e+11 0
His chest x-ray prior to discharge demonstrated very small left -1.89384488287e+12 0
sided effusion without any significant failure. -2.42512048002e+15 0
DISPOSITION: The patient will be transferred to rehabilitation -7.94478872768e+15 0

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 50 year-old man with -4035950.6714 0
valvular cardiomyopathy , status post -4.53769988092e+18 0
three aortic valve replacements who presents with no acute -1.33715416635e+13 0
complaints but progressive decline in daily function. Mr. Toher 's -9.34727791586e+13 0
history begins in March of 1995 when he presented with shortness of -1357092661.95 0
breath , dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea in the setting of -487814349.013 0
medication ( Lasix and/or Procardia for hypertension ). 1.8473875898e+12 1
Noncompliant , he was found by echo to have severe aortic -57115387.617 0
insufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation , left ventricular -1.73079817449e+24 0
hypokinesis and ejection fraction of 45%. He subsequently -35464918890.0 0
underwent aortic valve replacement along with a mitral valve -2.00498101421e+14 0
repair , aortic valve pathology showed myxomatous degeneration. One -1.97080636309e+18 0
month post surgery he required repeat aortic valve replacement with -1.8860322919e+14 0
dehiscence and was documented to have an annular abscess with -3.18443788195e+11 0
cultures positive for yeast. At this time he also required -14294571981.2 0
coronary artery reimplantation and annular repair. -5.76529294949e+17 0
HOSPITAL COURSE: His hospital course was additionally complicated -3.58454567813e+17 0
by the development of third degree heart block -8202159228.36 0
necessitating the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. After -2.31337344855e+20 0
discharge Mr. Ogaz did generally well for the following years -2.44066550398e+11 0
until March of 1999 when he again presented with increasing -29812613190.0 0
shortness of breath. Echo then revealed moderate to severe aortic -1.88703548345e+13 0
insufficiency with moderate mitral regurgitation. Cardiac -3.54846464947e+32 0
catheterization showed clear coronary arteries. At this time his -1.59606637884e+16 0
aortic valve was again replaced with a St. Jude valve. Again -635054130.8 0
following discharge Mr. Bassi did generally well until March of -2.06430348175e+12 0
2001 when again he presented with shortness of breath. At that -1985163655.04 0
time echo showed at least mild paravalvular aortic regurgitation -2.71844838172e+16 0
with left ventricular dilatation ( systolic diameter 6.1 cm ) along -1.52551115357e+11 0
with 1+ mitral regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid regurgitation and an -8.20013907425e+12 0
ejection fraction of 15 to 20%. Stress testing at this time showed 3169967.30825 1
a physical work capacity of 15.1. It is not documented what was -118406913.725 0
done at this time but apparently his Lasix was increased from 40 309598246.575 1
b.i.d. to 80 b.i.d. with good effect. 5739216.0294 1
Regarding this admission , Mr. Clyatt reports that he has been -4158523978.53 0
feeling fine and has been in the hospital because his doctors want -1557908416.69 0
to replace his valve , or if that doesn't work to give him a new -6626.99718608 0
heart. He reports no increasing dyspnea , fatigue , ankle edema or -982331305.18 0
abdominal girth. He sleeps on three pillows at night and has not -185003488.505 0
recently been shortness of breath when lying flat. He is able to -166445557.517 0

poorly controlled blood sugars until Metformin was added in -2.97781762975e+13 0
March of 1996. In the past five years the patient has also -964465.577421 0
become morbidly obese with a weight of greater than 200 pounds. -179733001.178 0
Since 1995 she has noted development of significant bilateral lower -1.98084001769e+14 0
extremity swelling. In March of 1996 she was treated for diabetic -27520926878.2 0
stasis ulcers on both of her legs with cellulitis requiring home IV -898609486.575 0
antibiotics. Part of the bilateral lower extremity swelling was -7.9350782551e+15 0
attributed to the presence of a large uterine fibroid which was -7606761582.22 0
thought to be compromising venous return. Her massive edema was -2.50328871822e+12 0
treated unsuccessfully with Lasix. -1.64471564112e+16 0
The patient was doing well until about a week prior to admission -286851386.611 0
when she developed some diarrhea consisting of two to three bowel -18995029854.5 0
movements a day. Her stool was watery brown without any blood or -316863447.926 0
mucus. She also reported some nausea and vomiting as well as -944832885.001 0
chills. She believes that she had fevers , but these temperatures -37130910424.5 0
were not measured. One day after the onset of her diarrhea the -49329595.9621 0
patient noted the development of burning pain on her left anterior -64813258533.1 0
thigh just above her knee. This was associated with increased -2.69350578602e+11 0
erythema and mildly increased swelling in that area. She reports -9.21857313492e+12 0
that her diarrhea , there had been stool running down her left thigh -81771498.3809 0
the previous day. This area of erythema on her left leg 6853518.64897 1
subsequently spread to the lateral surface of the thigh and was -8792266812.09 0
associated with increasing pain. The pain was so severe that it -6651682319.68 0
prevented the patient from her daily activities and from walking. -1.00476480536e+11 0
The patient presented to the Emergency Department on 2/29 for -2.26119785088e+11 0
worsening of her lower extremity pain and decreased p.o. intake. -30597087211.2 0
On the day of admission the patient states that her diarrhea had -291995039.246 0
resolved and that she has had no abdominal pain. She has had no -7871216.36983 0
chest pain or shortness of breath or any other localizing signs of -968688321.357 0
infection except her left leg. On admission she was found to have -275697001.043 0
a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and she was placed in the -757341717.538 0
Short Stay Unit. Subsequently her admission labs were noted to -7.34453876467e+11 0
reveal elevated LFTs and an elevated BUN and creatinine with a -6822068561.41 0
white blood cell count of 35 , 000. Because of these abnormalities -412294824.385 0
and renal failure , the patient was transferred out of the Short -396010549.19 0

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION: Sodium 133 , potassium 5.2 , BUN 43 , and 8153791.10357 1
creatinine of 3.7. The patient's last -926411917.528 0
creatinine value on record was in July of 1996 which was 0.6. Her -1952195.18793 0
LFTs revealed an ALT of 71 , AST of 57 , LDH 717 , alkaline 8023.18916312 1
phosphatase 196 , total bilirubin 1.1 , direct bilirubin 0.6. Her -20252090144.8 0
amylase was 8. Her albumin was 2.1 and her calcium was 8.2. Her 1752801.89539 1
CBC on admission revealed a white cell count of 34 , 000 , hematocrit 1782464.49667 1
of 29 , and platelets of 624 , 000. The differential on the white 602620.043055 1
blood cell count was 78 polys , 38 bands , 6 lymphs , 3 monocytes , and 40482.581735 1
no eos. Her MCV on her hematocrit was 77. Her PT and PTT were 107832.574809 1
both within normal limits. Her urinalysis revealed 3+ protein , 1+ -67589716835.7 0
leukocyte esterase , 8-12 white blood cells , 20-25 red blood cells , 23931104.234 1

Chest x-ray on admission revealed low lung volumes with possible -6.97972047019e+12 0
left total effusion that was blurring left lower lobe air space -9226878155.09 0
disease. Abdominal ultrasound performed on admission revealed no -8.11232906202e+21 0
hydronephrosis , a normal liver biliary system. Study was limited -2.25122433387e+13 0
secondary to body habitus. Lower extremity non-invasive studies -1.84903833709e+21 0
revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis. However , exam was 30275703456.2 1
limited secondary to habitus. -1.84947228712e+11 0
HOSPITAL COURSE: By issues: -2399376272.72 0
1. Left thigh cellulitis: The patient was started on Ancef 293538773.133 1
renally dosed for her left thigh cellulitis. Her legs were kept -6052680196.13 0
raised and her white blood cell and fever curves followed. An -336697095.326 0
Infectious Disease consult as well as a Dermatology consult was -2.00256059256e+12 0
obtained to assist with antibiotics as well as dressing for her -5995344868.48 0
lower extremity changes. Blood cultures and wound cultures sent -9.14735451206e+15 0
did not reveal any organisms. Because of the patient's very high -617465586.213 0
white blood cell count , the ID consult team was concerned for the -20721521.1855 0
possibility of toxic shock syndrome; therefore , Clindamycin IV was -59045111130.4 0
also added to her regimen of antibiotics. Also per ID -458781.933068 0
recommendation , stool cultures were sent for E. coli 0167: H7 which -9663121.58552 0
was negative. Although there was an initial fall in the patient's -1246269906.33 0
white count during the first several days of antibiotics , this -7853610434.71 0
white count subsequently began rising again. This was associated -3.2179679311e+16 0
with continued poor resolution of the pain in the patient's left -564782084.175 0
thigh and perhaps worsening erythema. Because the patient's left -2.98363867365e+13 0
leg did not appear to be getting better on antibiotics , a Surgical -58370533.2068 0
consult was obtained to rule out a deeper seated infection in the -687525294.174 0
patient's thigh. Imaging of the patient's leg with MRI was 4744379.33759 1
attempted but was unsuccessful secondary to the patient's large -7.17956850862e+12 0
size. A CT of both of her legs were obtained instead which -3614258.5893 0
revealed no evidence of an abscess in her left leg , however , it did 343252.700806 1
incidentally detect a large effusion in the patient's left knee. -1130602277.62 0
One week after admission the patient noted acute worsening of the -34909150625.8 0
pain in her left knee. Because of the known left knee effusion , a 206600.586522 1
concern for a septic knee joint was raised. A Rheumatology consult -93206831798.6 0
was obtained. The left knee was tapped using ultrasound guidance -1.14564901851e+13 0
removing 20 cc of turbid knee fluid. Studies on the left knee 10839126.9761 1
effusion revealed 13 , 000 white blood cells with negative gram stain -3865007291.06 0
and negative crystal exam times 3. Cultures of the left knee fluid 569499975.756 1
did not grow any organisms. Despite these findings , we were still -1285879949.32 0
concerned that this was a partially treated septic joint given the -23331107131.1 0
patient had been on antibiotics for one week. For this reason an -285170372.954 0
Orthopedic consult was obtained and the patient was taken to the OR -3859992755.94 0
for possible debridement. On 6/15 the patient was taken to the -3937351053.15 0
Operating Room where an abscess on the left lateral distal thigh -16664859979.1 0
was found and drained. A total of approximately 20 cc of pus was -4949108.77657 0
removed by Dr. Sudler . There was no connection between the pus -139866118.919 0
collection and the left knee effusion. After the drainage , the -12951814181.3 0
patient's clinical status improved dramatically with a decrease in -2.11524586546e+14 0
her white count and increased mobility of her leg. She was -63432028.9115 0
continued on Ancef IV and p.o. Ofloxacillin which had been added 10155081951.6 1
for gram negative coverage. The Clindamycin was subsequently -3.21832383524e+18 0
discontinued. On the day prior to discharge the patient's white -16327963193.7 0
blood cell count had fallen to 10 , 000. She remained afebrile. -3086879.04214 0
2. Renal: On admission the patient was noted to have a creatinine -30520167.6625 0
of 3.7 with a baseline known to be 0.6 in July of 1996. However , on 50473.0771054 1
searching through the patient's records it appears that the patient -4.56088417288e+11 0
had been noted to have increased proteinuria since July of 1996. -532655061.101 0
The acute renal failure was initially thought to be secondary to -12277077078.2 0
dehydration; the patient was given IV hydration with no improvement -3.99738561851e+11 0
in her creatinine. For that reason , a Renal consult was obtained -360099328.514 0
on the third day of admission. It was the impression of the Renal -16222860.6162 0
Service that the patient's acute renal failure was likely -12599058881.9 0
multifactorial secondary to a combination of diabetic nephropathy , -3.39049512073e+18 0
low albumin , volume loss secondary to diarrhea , infection , and -233381123.05 0
medications which included NSAIDs as well as ACE inhibitor. For -2.18975232545e+12 0
that reason , the patient's nephrotoxic medications , which include -4.55803583208e+11 0
Lisinopril and Metformin , were discontinued. The patient's -9.41864507215e+13 0
electrolytes and volume status was followed closely for the rest of -2.25567558867e+11 0
the course of the hospitalization with continued gradual -1.32295090765e+16 0
improvement. Her creatinine peaked at 4.7. On discharge the -4.99610189851e+13 0
patient's creatinine had resolved back to 2.2. -187702079.052 0
3. Right upper extremity swelling: On the day after the patient -276301409.655 0
returned from the Operating Room for the drainage of her left -1760892158.74 0
thigh , she was found to have new onset of swelling in her right arm 56343.2915335 1
and breast. Initially we were concerned for the presence of a -2575010609.36 0
right upper extremity deep venous thrombosis. Upper extremity -4.59017091265e+19 0
non-invasive studies were obtained which were negative for any -3.3314009377e+15 0
clots. An echocardiogram was also obtained showing no evidence of -2.17910199869e+13 0
right heart dysfunction. A nuclear flow study was also attempted -6.30405834883e+12 0
but was unsuccessful because of the failure to obtain venous access -2.26743480107e+11 0
on the patient's right arm. The Leahgulf Mary Katon Hospital team was also 95806176.6014 1
consulted regarding the use of heparin. However , given that the -17478666107.6 0
patient had poor access and had an anemia , it was decided that the -3040653.26437 0
patient would not be heparinized. Her right upper extremity -5.01592701933e+13 0
swelling was observed closely and with elevation of the right arm -53936612902.6 0
over the next few days gradually resolved without any -21928825100.6 0
complications. On the day prior to discharge a repeat right upper -34909150625.8 0
extremity ultrasound was obtained which revealed no evidence of -1.28569756679e+16 0
blood clots in her right arm. 265622.887587 1
4. Hematology: On admission the patient was found to have a low -7832952.71018 0
hematocrit with a low MVC. Iron studies were performed which -96617343656.5 0
revealed the likely presence of iron deficiency. For that reason -7.122293715e+12 0
the patient was placed on iron sulfate 30 mg t.i.d. The patient 132113599.16 1
was guaiac negative , thus ruling out evidence of a chronic GI -63650134.9719 0
bleed. The patient's anemia is also likely a reflection of her -131350537.709 0
renal dysfunction. -4.91621077075e+13 0
5. GI: Although the patient had experienced some diarrhea prior -16555904095.9 0
to admission , her diarrhea resolved in the hospital. All of her -137697288.354 0
stool studies were negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed no -4.4685068267e+19 0
abnormalities in the patient's liver or biliary system to account -1.03837121406e+11 0
for the mild transaminitis found on admission. It is likely that -15175364309.6 0
the patient had a bout of viral gastroenteritis a few days prior to -78552689.1444 0
admission which resolved spontaneously. -1.31006703584e+22 0

CARDIOVERSION. -8.72105982317e+20 0
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 38-year-old African -79368941110.0 0
American gentleman with a familial -2.94619678572e+15 0
dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of approximately -3.377031667e+22 0
20 percent , history of ventricular tachycardia status post AICD -7.12495821979e+12 0
placement , and recurrent atrial fibrillation status post two prior -2.96878830617e+14 0
attempts at cardioversion. The patient had also previously been -5.8016928563e+15 0
begun on amiodarone for chemical cardioversion , however , he 5.0510915865e+11 1
developed severe hyperthyroidism. The patient also has had several -4.65660733004e+17 0
recent admissions for exacerbations of his congestive heart -9.85502098858e+17 0
failure , most recently in February , 1998 when he was admitted for -11654347.6251 0

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 60-year-old white -8121104183.14 0
male who was admitted with complaints -9.06929767497e+11 0
of cough , mild shortness of breath and persistent fevers. In 1981 , -15448287.6287 0
the patient was admitted to Nalher Hospital with -1.22777045866e+11 0
syncope secondary to aortic stenosis. A porcine AVR was performed -1.00256525779e+13 0
at that time. He had an unremarkable course until 2/20/90 , when -276301409.655 0
echocardiogram performed at TH showed an AV gradient of 64 mm of -164666633.626 0
mercury , mild to moderate MR , LVH , and normal function. A blowing 1248273.67132 1
diastolic murmur was noted on physical exam at that time. On -213621232.57 0
0/4/91 , the patient underwent an ETT that was nondiagnostic due to -2292343741.92 0
baseline EKG abnormalities. However , he had no substernal chest -7.122293715e+12 0
pain after 12 minutes and 20 seconds. Around the end of March 7617013.09232 1
1991 , the patient noted increasing fatigue , increased temperature , -1.35078939568e+12 0
and some upper respiratory symptoms including cough and sore -2.65603153264e+14 0
throat. He claims that his sore throat lasted for nearly a month -164666633.626 0
then went away for one week only to return again for nearly one 3177816.76789 1
month. He had been treated with amoxicillin without improvement. -1.53073749148e+13 0
One week prior to admission , he had persistent symptoms with a -78583678.6182 0
cough with poor sputum production but the sputum that was produced -1.09382354358e+11 0
was yellow-green in color. He was treated with erythromycin in a 17647158608.8 1
single dose before hospitalization. Also , one week prior to -53065516671.1 0
admission , he noted some left chest pain without radiation that is -2083920868.94 0
typical of his chest pain syndrome which had been previously -77122458728.6 0
diagnosed. On the day of admission , the patient noted increased -18591394037.9 0
persistent elevation in his temperature and a chest x-ray showed -9.71868545553e+12 0

border and a II/VI crescendo/decrescendo murmur at the apex with -1.09885883446e+13 0
extension to the axilla. Lungs revealed scattered rhonchi and few -2.78148389459e+13 0
rales especially in the left lung field. Extremities were without -2.18532663448e+13 0
cyanosis , clubbing or edema. -13913062.7854 0
LABORATORY DATA: On admission included a glucose of 172. White 7762900413.16 1
blood cell count 7.7. Hematocrit 41.2. Platelet -3.63386553828e+14 0

Urinalysis had 1+ protein , 1+ glucose , 1-3 white cells , 1-3 red 2796881.60514 1
cells , trace bacteria and 2-5 hyaline casts. EKG revealed normal -32801521446.9 0
sinus rhythm at 96 , intervals of 0.20/0.08/0.40 with axis of -30 -46414750.0503 0
degrees. There was LVH with strain. Chest x-ray showed a -2323354925.86 0
questionable lingular infiltrate that was read as such by one -1.71793700151e+11 0
radiologist but this was not confirmed by a second radiologist. -21281968757.7 0
There was no sign of congestive heart failure on chest x-ray. -22953624.5837 0
HOSPITAL COURSE: When the patient was admitted , he was initially -1022526543.43 0
treated as if his presenting symptoms were due to -586333133.963 0
a left lingular pneumonia despite his lack of elevated white count. -3643261116.35 0
However , it was felt that endocarditis a small though real -307512837.697 0
possibility in this gentleman with AVR. Therefore , he was -11886110618.7 0
originally treated with ampicillin , 2 grams IV q six hours; 39040009.3256 1
gentamicin , 100 mg IV q eight hours; and erythromycin , 1 gram IV q 295920.550783 1
six hours to cover atypical bacteria including Legionella. Prior -2.31736870493e+16 0
to administering antibiotics , three blood cultures were obtained at -5.56727478335e+14 0
MLHH in addition to the two previously obtained at HH .  Sputum -18430411.8226 0
sample was also sent for gram stain and C&amp;S. All blood cultures 47440.9078666 1
remained negative throughout the hospitalization. Sputum culture -4.24411374547e+29 0
showed only normal flora. When the second radiologist read the -7.38737431297e+11 0
chest x-ray as being inconsistent with lingular pneumonia , a more -67589716835.7 0
aggressive search for possible endocarditis was undertaken. An -2.43094802367e+20 0
echocardiogram was performed on 7/6 that showed an aortic valve -1.77674647656e+12 0
with 40 mm gradient , 2-3+ AI , 1+ MR , mild LVF and no regional wall 18305.6293724 1
motion abnormalities. There was no evidence of vegetation on the -7.70700476677e+12 0
echo. Side by side comparison of this echocardiogram with the -2.6576788816e+11 0
echocardiogram from 4/27 done at LEH showed no significant -1.1779970458e+13 0
interval change. An Infectious Disease consult was sought and it -1.04986082381e+13 0
was felt by these consultants that endocarditis was an unlikely -1.39891485352e+12 0
diagnosis given the lack of change in echocardiogram and lack of -19160876965.2 0
additional signs of SBE. It was ultimately felt that the patient's -1812977702.79 0
shortness of breath and elevated temperature were due to bronchitis -2.03600063247e+14 0
and he was switched to po Bactrim to continue a ten day course of 543648.503234 1
therapy. Although the initial goal of his hospitalization was to -6.40241895728e+12 0
keep him hospitalized until cardiac catheterization and valve -2.89213337716e+19 0
replacement could be performed , the patient's personal situation -6.31518081398e+13 0
made it unfeasible to keep him in the hospital for a longer period -27617283.5534 0
of time than absolutely necessary. Furthermore , there were -4.05166502207e+13 0
questions about whether cardiac catheterization and AVR should be -1.15273416747e+17 0
performed in someone being treated for presumed acute bronchitis -3.27369063646e+16 0
and whether his very poor oral hygiene and dental work can be -26117932.7174 0
corrected prior to surgery. For these reasons , Dr. Kanda in -385851822.569 0
Cardiology was consulted as well as Dr. Sandidge in ERH Medicine and -3686286829.33 0
both concurred that the patient could be discharged with close -3.66667382519e+11 0
follow-up by his primary care physician , Dr. Jess . His condition 90670550.9076 1

further episodes of nausea and diaphoresis. Because of his -1.59874821536e+13 0
baseline conduction system disease , an exercise tolerance test -1.18269031946e+16 0
could not be performed and the patient was sent for an exercise -216574403.249 0
tolerance test thallium. However , prior to the test , the patient -695654312.08 0
became diaphoretic and nauseous with a non-palpable blood pressure. -9.26857278668e+14 0
He was treated with an intravenous fluid bolus with subsequent -4.95981714956e+11 0
improvement. Because he was felt too unstable to undergo a nuclear -56187999661.4 0

LABORATORY EXAMINATION: Significant for a sodium of 140 , a -832876042.948 0
potassium of 4.4 , BUN of 28 , creatinine 1231308.54691 1
1.7 , glucose of 110 , white count was 6.4 , hematocrit was 47.6 , 225600.975115 1
platelets were 137 , 000 , his PT was 13.6 , and his PTT was 47.3. His 10445.8071837 1
chest X-Ray at Andsi Medical Center revealed an enlarged heart with -1.90108067286e+11 0
no pulmonary infiltrates , his EKG from 2/10/94 at the Massbarre County Memorial Hospital revealed sinus bradycardia at 56 , left posterior -1.28378317997e+12 0
hemi-block with non-specific intraventricular conduction delay , and -1.27105471202e+25 0
poor R wave progression across his precordium. He had deep T wave -375541028.637 0
inversion in III and F , this EKG was also notable for a pattern of 198626.133116 1
alternating conduction delay with alternating pattern of left -2.5221187155e+19 0
anterior and left posterior hemi-block. -4.1094831897e+14 0
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization -1.6389666635e+17 0
on 10/25/94 which revealed hemodynamics of a -2.42451711866e+12 0
right atrial mean of 6 , a right ventricular pressure of 28/6 , a 810191.95944 1
pulmonary capillary mean pressure of 14 , he had a totally occluded -1839359118.21 0
mid left anterior descending lesion , a tight second diagonal -1.76227600269e+11 0
lesion , a totally occluded OM1 lesion , and a 70% distal right 268155.541053 1
coronary artery lesion. His left ventriculogram revealed -1.36956220097e+22 0
anteroapical hypokinesis. On further analysis of the patient's -8.33267679804e+15 0
EKG , it was felt that he alternated between left anterior -132820004.464 0
hemi-block and left posterior hemi-block. It was felt that his -1.06102322135e+12 0
symptoms may be an indication of more advanced conduction system -6.73046053493e+12 0
disease that would possibly justify a pacer. At this point , the -358061366.731 0
decision was to monitor the patient with Holter monitoring and to -51603283734.8 0
perform a stress MIBI examination to assess if he degenerated to -11333250397.2 0
more severe conduction disease. Holter monitoring on 0/19 -4.21998406808e+16 0
revealed sinus rhythm between 40 and 85 , he had 14 hours of 655760.733518 1
occasional atrial premature beats , two hours of occasional -4.91621077075e+13 0
ventricular premature beats , each lasting less than a minute , as -1192252102.98 0
well as intermittent intraventricular conduction delay. He had no -1.08888865544e+17 0
symptoms during the 24 hours of Holter monitoring. He exercise -6.79810532164e+11 0
tolerance test MIBI examination revealed a modified Bruce protocol -5.72778996612e+17 0
on which he went twelve minutes stopping secondary to leg fatigue , -1713622382.62 0
he had no chest pain , his maximum heart rate was 112 , his maximum 236798.609032 1
blood pressure was 195/95 , he had no change in his baseline EKG as 1110449.50923 1
well as no ST changes , and no arrhythmias. His MIBI evaluation -92024269.147 0
revealed a fixed inferior defect extending to the posterior septum. -5.44907431133e+11 0
Given the above information , particularly the fact that the patient -5.95277730355e+11 0
did not degenerate to more severe conduction system disease with -5.94862861943e+12 0
exercise , it was felt that a pacer would not be necessary at this -388278.192377 0
time. Moreover , the patient had no provokeable ischemia by MIBI -16664859979.1 0
evaluation and it was felt that revascularization was unnecessary. -2.63112187608e+14 0
The decision then was to send the patient home on an adequate -48708770.0685 0
medical regimen which was achieved during his hospital course via -1.92865447819e+13 0
the addition of Captopril to his medical regimen to provide him 8167696852.49 1
with adequate blood pressure control. It is noteworthy that the -2.1053287658e+12 0
patient had no episodes of nausea or diaphoresis during his -49781150769.6 0
hospitalization , that is ambulating without assistance with no -8.75568090919e+15 0
symptoms whatsoever. He is therefore felt to be stable for -13904357012.3 0
discharge and is being discharged to home. -773096288.446 0
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: Cardiac catheterization on 10/25/94 -1.10092453832e+21 0

levofloxacin and vancomycin. -8.54030052491e+17 0
HOSPITAL COURSE: -5.09951906026e+24 0
1. Infectious Disease. Initially , the source of her repeated -1.98625540171e+11 0
fevers was unclear. Multiple cultures were sent including urine -9.40578484353e+15 0
cultures , stool studies , peripheral blood cultures and blood -9.40821722074e+11 0
cultures from the PICC sputum cultures and induced sputum with -1.0732606874e+12 0
testing for PCP , given her history of chronic steroid uses -14091170.1957 0
without PCP prophylaxis. All of these came back negative with 60750782643.8 1
the exception of one blood culture from the PICC , which grew -36684751.0125 0

3. Pulmonary. On admission , the patient was noted to be hypoxic -266683113.106 0
on room air with an oxygen saturation of 79% to 80% , which 28096.4038265 1
increased to 93% on 2 L to 3 L of nasal cannula. Given this new 12931.5100442 1
hypoxia and her chronic decreased ambulation , she was sent for a -666278576.626 0
CT angiogram of the chest , which was negative for PE. The study -4955613.35607 0
also shows small bilateral pleural effusion and mild pulmonary -2.74838822267e+15 0
edema. Resolution of her previous pneumonia and possibly -1.14739197473e+16 0
reactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Given this data , she was -9.02694580049e+15 0
restarted on Lasix with diuresis , titrated to 1 L negative per 27474577.3148 1
day and was sound well. Given this data , she was restarted on -1965142.20623 0
Lasix with the diuresis titrated to 1 L negative per day and 3843102.37492 1
responded well. She had decreasing shortness of breath and -1.97793102617e+13 0
improved room air oxygen saturation up to 85% at the time of 1371288.17342 1
discharge. She is continued to be maintained on oxygen of 2 L -20607145.3544 0
nasal cannula with good oxygen saturation and is anticipated to -2.97346656327e+12 0
have a successful gradual wean from oxygen as her diuresis -12392533474.5 0
continue after discharge. The Pulmonary Service was consulted -3.59652093328e+19 0

1. Orthopedics. There is no update on his orthopedics course. -3079316902.83 0
He needs to continue his heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice -2.89898666282e+12 0
daily for one month following his surgery , which was 3/14/07 , so -8231318.79074 0
he just about to complete this one month course. He should be on 1004396.11099 1
Ultram 50 mg every twelve hours as needed for pain. All 26044508.204 1
narcotics should be avoided as these results in severe delirium -1.84742856998e+12 0
for Mr. Puotinen 1977581541.96 1
No update to cardiovascular ischemia. -7.04080193164e+12 0
Cardiovascular rhythm. His Lopressor continued to be held for -5.58197795045e+14 0
the remainder of his hospitalization. His blood pressure was -1.76493025417e+14 0
within normal limits between 100-110/60-70 and his heart rate -7.26705848622e+14 0
remained in the 60s-70s , no higher than the 80s. If his blood -505179.967136 0
pressure increases , starting Lopressor again at 25 mg twice daily -52032206439.4 0
would be wise , however , currently his blood pressure is not high -1860787.03874 0
nor does his rate require this. -20419.0707035 0
There is no uptake to his renal course. He continued on his -2459975.21009 0
dialysis on Tuesday , Thursday , and Saturdays. However , he also -76267912.9252 0
got dialysis on Friday the 3 of May since he is being discharged -5797438.29269 0
today , so that he can be changed to a Monday , Wednesday , and 29573.2151305 1
Friday dialysis course at the Ans General Medical Center -1.31196127868e+12 0
From an endocrine perspective , he remained on sliding scale -78206673232.8 0
insulin only. He did not need to be restarted on his Lantus. 509129.74864 1
There is no further update to his GI oncologic history. He -83945629.0147 0
should continue to follow up with Dr. Trimboli on in 11/8/07 at -40992943.8443 0
3:00 p.m. 496.114775458 1
From a delirium perspective , his Zyprexa 2.5 mg at bedtime was 251800890.83 1
discontinued after his sense of delirium has been cleared for -2.93737796178e+11 0
multiple days. However , if he were to start to have any sorts of 227248.977374 1
hallucinations or issues with confusion , we would restart the -9.55878639839e+11 0
Zyprexa immediately 2.5 mg at bedtime +2.5 mg as needed. The 2517026556.34 1
patient is currently stable again off Zyprexa , but it has only 133609252.66 1
been discontinued for two days , so he may well need this to be 43889.5218706 1
added on. As soon as the Zyprexa is added on , he has cleared his 73178.6008125 1
delirium pretty quickly , so this has been quite effective for -2711665327.32 0
him. 77.8697653621 1
From an ID perspective. He was continued on his rifampin 300 mg 75279048.01 1

consistent with with a watershed infarct. There was no evidence of -78562069271.8 0
acute bleed. -144778.356491 0
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 63 year-old Hispanic male with -539021507.843 0
the following important medical issues to be -2.06629151944e+12 0
managed: -8.79280149212e+27 0
( 1 ) Cardiovascular. The patient presented without chest pain , but -1942488494.22 0
EKG changes , including .5 mm of ST segment depression in lead I , 2382730.7193 1
and 1 mm of ST segment depression in leads II , and V4 through V6. 72942.3585832 1
There was no prior EKG for comparison. Given his multiple cardiac -27178073957.7 0
risk factors , a decision was made to rule the patient out for -334635.226255 0
myocardial infarction. His serial creatinine kinase levels were -2.20951759415e+21 0
67/74/115. Given the low levels , there was no MB fractionation -7833844660.87 0
done. The patient also was placed on Holter monitor to attempt to -504984240.925 0
rule out a dysrhythmic etiology of his deficit. Holter showed -2.14781450972e+11 0
predominantly a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 442 to 98. There -4194057.49838 0
were 7 atrial premature beats , and 5 ventricular premature beats , -1324136522.56 0
as well as a 12-beat run of supraventricular tachycardia at a rate -1089113690.6 0
of 125 , and a 6-beat run of ventricular tachycardia at 144. All of 1261051.92327 1
these were asymptomatic. The patient underwent transthoracic -7.87903177667e+25 0
echocardiography while an inpatient , to rule out a vegetative -6.73508568867e+11 0
source of emboli , which may have resulted in his change in -681058.094083 0
sensation. Echocardiogram demonstrated concentric left ventricular 4.99480791067e+44 1
hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 65%. There was a -1972773.59713 0
thickened aortic leaflet with calcification of the right and left -2.61050206504e+13 0
coronary cusps of the aortic valve. No shunt was visualized. The -11779117114.4 0
patient had no occurrence of chest pain or shortness of breath -2905098307.84 0
while admitted to the Louili Mi Hospital . These events -1394025471.41 0
were thought to be entirely non-cardiac in nature , and he was -60712489.7387 0
removed from Telemetry. The patient's hypertension was managed -6.45912898078e+15 0
with Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. during this admission , and 3795773224.25 1
switched to 30 mg of Nifedipine XL p.o. q.d. as an outpatient. His 84385936.5562 1
blood pressure should be followed as an outpatient , and additions -1.21369491285e+11 0
and adjustments made accordingly. -3.08366087851e+15 0
( 2 ) Neurologic. The patient was admitted with what appeared to be -32514163.0841 0
a purse sensory defect of the right hemisphere , resulting in left -999605334.144 0
facial and upper extremity numbness. He was seen in consultation -9.00520000829e+12 0
by the Neurology Service. CT scan of the head without contrast in -402281446.031 0
the Emergency Room was negative for acute bleed. In the Emergency -38696887743.1 0
Room , the patient received one enteric coated aspirin , and he was 127622024.901 1
not started on intravenous heparinization. It was unclear , -4.11775193001e+13 0
initially , whether the etiology of this patient's change in -1698140040.33 0
neurological status was secondary to embolic phenomena or possibly -6.90773118376e+17 0
a second watershed infarct. Given his negative echocardiogram of -3.49081734241e+16 0
the heart , as well as a negative Holter monitor , it was thought 161331.691628 1
that the etiology of this patient's left-sided facial numbness was -1.73349668576e+11 0
not cardiac in nature. It was the feeling of the Neurology Service -1172257589.33 0
that the patient had experienced a right-sided subcortical infarct , -9.38189337016e+14 0
probably in the right thalamus region. He was also noted to have -297167312.693 0
risk factors for small vessel disease , including hypertension and -8.49926599803e+13 0
diabetes. His numbness appeared to be resolving on aspirin alone; 1.8467488332e+11 1
however , on the second day of admission , the patient began to -480201.088062 0
develop dysarthria. There was concern that the patient was having -2.35644328659e+13 0
an evolving cerebrovascular accident that was involving the -1.67318731838e+18 0
brainstem , given tongue involvement. He was thus started on -1.04377704915e+11 0
intravenous heparinization. His dysarthria promptly resolved. He -5.82771815178e+29 0
underwent MRI with and without contrast of the head , three days -125883982.028 0
after the initial event , which demonstrated only right-sided small -2.60861479955e+14 0
vessel disease. There was no evidence of acute bleed or underlying -1.25711176422e+11 0
vascular abnormality. Given the small vessel disease in this -2.32323413305e+14 0
patient , he was taken off intravenous heparin and continued on one -2323150892.87 0
aspirin a day. He did well during the remainder of his stay. He 12247492.6301 1
was seen in consultation by Physical Therapy and Occupational -6.89811014184e+14 0
Therapy , who , in conjunction with the patient's family , believed -37450721.0538 0
that he was at a somewhat decreased level of functioning from his -533866026.975 0
baseline , given his sensory changes. He is thus to be sent for -1012825.80134 0
inpatient rehabilitation for his new cerebrovascular accident , and -2.27303092032e+18 0
then to be followed as an outpatient in Dr. Lacrosse 's clinic. He -7750599.41279 0
will continue on one aspirin a day for life. His right-sided 1561331503.54 1
scapular and shoulder pain is chronic , after sustaining his initial -6.41086579087e+11 0
left-sided cerebrovascular accident. It should be treated with -1.64998486427e+20 0
physical therapy , including ultrasound and stretching maneuvers. -5.49000392267e+17 0
The patient was also placed on Naproxen for pain relief. 2128146.75662 1
Muscle relaxants may be tried as an outpatient if the above stated -1351340763.26 0
efforts do not help reduce this patient's pain. -7152329.23578 0
( 3 ) Infectious disease. This patient had no infectious -2392910408.83 0
complications while hospitalized. He was , however , found to have a -4093923244.21 0
slight peripheral eosinophilia during this admission , and was -2.86910793945e+15 0
evaluated by O&amp;P of the stool. Stool evaluation showed moderate -23226274.6449 0
hook worm eggs , as well as rare Trichuris trichiura eggs. He was 12659753.1873 1
treated with three days of Mebendazole. -80385997.1018 0
( 4 ) Endocrine. The patient has a history of Type II diabetes , on 242546.262166 1
Diabeta. The patient's blood glucose levels were checked by finger -45439786251.0 0
stick four times daily , and were in the 190's to 240's range during 166493.2105 1
this admission. He was covered with a CZI sliding scale of regular -1243401823.32 0
insulin. The patient was advised by Dietary on the American -41176608790.8 0

palpable on his abdomen. Due to his poor vascularization of his -2928947094.53 0
right lower extremity , he underwent a femoropopliteal bypass -6.07335708696e+14 0
grafting on the right with a nonreversed saphenous vein grafting -5.58527920754e+12 0

worsening of the left lower extremity perfusion. His left foot -7.94782613202e+11 0
was slightly cooler than his right and his Doppler signals -18559927433.1 0

his PT and DP on the right are dopplerable as well with biphasic -2686430.30471 0
signal. The same day , his Foley catheter was removed and he -11928397.7621 0

LABORATORY DATA: -5.09951906026e+24 0
At the time of admission , the patient's significant labs were as -19945509.4294 0
follows , his potassium was 4.3 , BUN was 38 , creatinine was 3.2 , 190348.415751 1
and his blood glucose was 187. His white blood cell count was 12421437.2936 1
12.6 and hematocrit was 27.8. -16952300.1992 0
HOSPITAL COURSE: -5.09951906026e+24 0
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service under -5.87462651142e+11 0
Dr. Tosco and was started on vancomycin , levofloxacin , and 549355635.16 1
Flagyl. He continued to have low-grade fevers over the course of -14321813141.0 0
the next three days. Finally , on hospital day 3 , had a fever of 87269.1504387 1
103.2. It was decided that at the time of admission , the patient -8936651.25073 0
would need to undergo an amputation of the third and fourth toe -196624760.814 0
as well as metatarsal heads to remove the infected bone and -440270981.465 0
source of osteomyelitis. On hospital day 3 , the patient was -223965328.767 0
taken to the operating room. It should be noted at that time -18660804.8032 0
that the patient's creatinine bumped before his operation from a -38923533078.5 0
BUN of 39 and a creatinine of 2.1 to a BUN of 59 on hospital day 13936.8801172 1
3 and a creatinine of 3.9. This occurred coincidentally the day -12172980960.0 0
after the patient had several MRIs of is lower extremities to -1566797854.59 0
better understand the vascular supply to his lower extremities. -7.03690083072e+12 0
Therefore , the patient had contrast dye. Although , this dye was -697331855.011 0
gadolinium , which is sued commonly for MRA and is not usually -67103968.5904 0
associated with any soft of renal toxicities. -8680553942.38 0
The patient was taken to the operating room on hospital day 3 for -9722166.80991 0
a right fourth and fifth toe amputation and nonhealing ulcer -1.84370391616e+11 0
debridement. Please refer to the operative note by Dr. -491569535.147 0
Guemmer for further details. The patient tolerated the -5.43501002533e+14 0
procedure without any problems and the patient control was -1.96651759963e+13 0
adequate by postoperative day 1. However on postoperative lab -6.13662992937e+14 0
checkup , it was see that the patient's creatinine bumped to 4.9 -7121141.85003 0
with a BUN of 61. This was viewed and was monitored by serial -1255571.79195 0
BUN and creatinine checks. The following , BUN and creatinine -4.6840108261e+11 0
came back at 69 for BUN and 5.2 for creatinine. On postoperative -161144739.382 0
day #1 , the patient's creatinine continued to rise and was found -1432928.12962 0
to be 6.5 with a BUN of 81. At this point , the renal service was 7926.49172996 1
consulted for further input as far as possible causes of acute -2368706908.9 0
renal failure in the phase of chronic renal insufficiency and -3.42372621537e+11 0
postoperative period. The patient's vancomycin level came to be -3.80212552716e+12 0
in the therapeutic range of 30.8. FENa was checked which -1332674149.22 0
revealed 0.74% FENa. This was rechecked and revealed a FENa of -100161799.429 0
0.97% both , which indicated prerenal failure. Renal team also -7863080849.92 0
advised checking for other causes of the patient's anemia as well -920816064.25 0
as other causes of the renal failure. Labs have been sent and -43208509.412 0
some are currently pending regarding the C3-C4 and anti-GMB -6.48708614462e+13 0
antibodies. -6.17596454935e+12 0
The patient's creatinine continued to rise despite advanced -1.64550266856e+14 0
management including with IV resuscitation , fluid volume boluses , -1.84442016061e+14 0
and occasional boluses of Lasix. Eventually , the patient's BUN -17283451011.3 0
and creatinine rose to 94 and 8.3 by postoperative day 2. By the -2879696.96215 0
following day , however postoperative day 3 , the patient's -616290693.012 0
creatinine and BUN began resolving that BUN of 95 and a -16711368.5455 0
creatinine 7.8. However , at the same time , the patient began -60394101.8231 0
having hypoglycemic episodes in response to the Lantus dose that -4.58190921134e+12 0
he was getting at home and continue to get here in hospital. It -1813459.52561 0
was summarized by the renal team as well as by the surgical -5815369.01958 0
service and that the patient may have not been taking his -94155396.2794 0
medication at home and now was being his medications , while here -421443516.055 0
in the hospital. By postoperative day 4 , the patient continued -7863080849.92 0
to have dysregulation of his fingerstick blood glucoses ranging -5.8016928563e+15 0
from a high of 367 to a low of 52 where she began to be 66.2617743885 1
symptomatic , somewhat somnolent , and groggy. -53265540674.7 0
This patient's blood glucose control was evaluated by the -17862882471.2 0
diabetes management service and it was summarized by them that -9.99430872621e+11 0
the patient's renal insufficiency had a significant role in the -18063074387.6 0
patient's hypoglycemic episodes and that he ended up having -1.18345251872e+11 0
insulin toxicity due to poor creatinine clearance and renal -6.85997144198e+13 0
functioning level. It should be noted that in light of this -367259770.745 0
patient's postoperative complications of acute renal failure in -3.30082216803e+16 0
the phase of chronic renal failure and chronic renal -21240654800.1 0
insufficiency , the patient never required a hemodialysis because -1.26183314353e+17 0
the potassium levels remained stable. The high that the patient -2.53764031097e+12 0
reached was 5.6 of potassium on the same day that he had a -28242.1306007 0
creatine of 8.3 , which was on postoperative day #2 , This was 227656.287578 1
treated with kayexalate and along the same lines , the patient's -597021163.628 0
medications were evaluated and it was decided to decrease it to -10746815331.8 0
b.i.d. dosing and to start holding lisinopril , Neurontin , and 6188531712.36 1
vancomycin for their possible renal toxic effects. A renal -1.21065816324e+13 0
ultrasound was obtained on postoperative day #1 as well as -204716854.943 0
Doppler flow studies. The renal ultrasound revealed normal -2.06602799574e+17 0
parenchyma with somewhat decreased renal indices indicating some -7.28472306655e+21 0
decreased amount of blood flow to their kidneys. At the same -464727250.96 0
time , an MRA of the renal arteries was obtained which revealed no -57369615.2489 0
stenosis lesions of the kidneys. -1472868593.71 0
The patient was eventually started on PhosLo and Ferrlecit as -1.35983372176e+11 0
well as Epogen 10 , 000 units q. week at the recommendation of the 1439630.75154 1
renal service. This was continued during the duration of the -79624626747.0 0
patient's stay and should continue in the postoperative -1.27491809826e+12 0
hospitalization. In light of this postoperative complications , -1.1391514219e+21 0
the creatinine became stable by postoperative day 3 and blood -3.22303128561e+11 0
pressure medications were restarted at previous doses and were -2.67535569083e+15 0
titrated to the need that the patient demonstrated by his blood -8081168563.89 0
pressure control. This was eventually attained on atenolol at -3.53866778981e+14 0
150 mg q.d. However , renal service recommended that the patient -11675091188.0 0
be given Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d. This seems to have controlled -3504408813.05 0
the patient's blood pressure for the time being. Physical -12326703405.1 0
therapy was also involved in evaluating the patient and assisted -9.21857313492e+12 0
in the management of this patient's care. 389856.652234 1
It should also be noted that a wax sponge was placed on the -215498.200152 0
patient's right open wound. This was placed on postoperative day -27731259591.7 0
#3 , 5/19/04 .  The patient seems to be tolerating this well. The -32301.3028624 0
diabetes management service , the physical therapy , and the renal -1.23732028997e+11 0
teams continued to follow the patient closely during the duration -2.07787144149e+13 0
of his stay until it was felt that the patient's postoperative -96557652.8963 0
complications and issues including blood glucose control as well -3.22775168963e+16 0
as renal insufficiency were under control. From an operative -1.71833918517e+14 0
standpoint , the patient tolerated the procedure well and it was -24419993529.3 0
decided to continue the patient on levofloxacin for a one week -295476673.454 0
course and the patient is to be discharged to the rehab facility , -38108404.1389 0
which is the Still Freedral Hospital for their ability to -7139532215.22 0

CVA , who presents with chest pain and a report of a syncopal 266842.605585 1
episode. He is followed at SRHO and has multiple multiple -9044695703.65 0
admissions for chest pain and rule out MI in the setting of 1941193.20904 1
receiving or having just received hemodialysis. On the day prior 6.68486878214e+11 1
to admission , 9/24/04 , the patient had chest pain and -11621038.7492 0
hemodialysis and was admitted to PACMH where he was ruled out for 962176108.631 1
MI by enzymes. He was discharged from BAHM on 1/2/04 and later -32001294.9919 0
that day , per the patient , he had a fight with his family members 210326.357784 1
and stood up and abruptly felt lightheaded and "passed out." He -68740239.5335 0
reports no palpitations or chest pain prior to the event and -1352120032.05 0
believes that he may have been unconscious for 20 minutes. -204716854.943 0
Talking to the family , the patient was actually attempting to -3819944388.88 0
throw something at this son , fell , and had no loss of 25897.7372932 1
consciousness after falling. The patient reports that he woke on -6.87876287953e+12 0
the floor and developed severe chest pain with radiation to the -11279254309.8 0
left arm and jaw , which is typical with his anginal symptoms -22470573.4446 0
according to his cardiologist. He denies any recent change in -2.06532439986e+11 0
chronic shortness of breath or exercise capacity , orthopnea , or -57339621100.8 0
increased edema. He had a recent MIBI on 9/13 that showed -84914058.9055 0
mild mid anterior and inferior wall ischemia with a -7771494689.62 0
posterior-basal scar. He was deemed an obvious surgical -2.83730807659e+15 0

In the emergency department , he received IV fluids , aspirin , 16459316.1689 1
sublingual nitroglycerin x 3 and morphine with resolution of -1.91303738651e+14 0
chest pain. Upon admission to the medical team , his vital signs -80274392.9369 0
were stable and he denied chest pain. He was admitted to rule -39035970.7295 0
out myocardial infarction. -2.24416433884e+15 0
HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUES: -2.93154238718e+14 0
1. Cardiovascular ischemia: This patient with a known history -6.10428669134e+11 0
of CAD who has been medically managed per his primary -157657130.528 0
cardiologist. He has a history of CABG. His last cath was in -5784443.48867 0
10/21 that showed diffuse disease. At which time , he received -3079316902.83 0
stents to the left main and LAD. On this admission , the patient -3260552.12572 0
ruled out for MI with three sets of negative cardiac enzymes -463293276.505 0
including troponin. No EKG changes were noted. He was continued -3.70639416606e+12 0
on aspirin products and beta-blocker as well as ACE inhibitor , -168590826.063 0
and amiodarone. The patient is not on a statin though he has 9965431.67146 1
been in the past; he reports that he had some sort of a reaction 4968.47598182 1
to the medication. On the day after his admission , he had chest -3835479.3144 0
pain and hemodialysis but was relieved by sublingual -1.77203267298e+13 0
nitroglycerin. Over his hospital course , he continued to have -6.84582625894e+11 0
2-3 episodes of chest pain per day that were relieved by 772850.376889 1
nitroglycerine and morphine. He had no EKG changes in the -10179804837.2 0
setting of any of these episodes. Isordil was added for improved -15632587492.7 0
pain control briefly. Cardiology was consulted and felt that the -9.91115333324e+12 0
frequency of the pain , the rapid onset and offset , and the -229144.006239 0
reproducibility of the pain to palpation made angina less likely; -32137945828.7 0
they did not feel that catheterization or further workup was -1.15402274445e+11 0
indicated. -32695878952.6 0
2. Cardiovascular pump function: Initially , the patient was dry -27841506059.2 0
on exam , and demonstrated no signs or symptoms of heart failure. -936793.504591 0
He was actually orthostatic by symptoms but his blood pressure -8.90674381277e+11 0
remained stable. His story of losing consciousness was difficult -2.61598205895e+16 0
to corroborate; if he did indeed lose consciousness , his history -764157153.312 0
is consistent with orthostasis. Management was monitored by the -1.1109229356e+16 0
Hemodialysis Service. 9.9074340173e+18 1
3. Cardiovascular rhythm: The patient has an ICD for history of -276077266.623 0
VT , and he is continued on amiodarone. There was concern that 9155811.62256 1
possible arrhythmia or pacer malfunction could have been the -2.13084019283e+14 0
cause of his symptoms. In addition , when he fell he said he 778054.655605 1
might have fallen on his pacemaker site. On the morning after -1413276803.03 0
his admission , when he was on hemodialysis , the patient and nurse 155201541.388 1
both heard a belching sound that seemed to be coming from the -66802151.4421 0
area of the patient's pacemaker. The electrophysiology team was -7.70139249311e+12 0
consulted and pacemaker was interrogated and found to be -2.56405231074e+12 0
functioning well , with no history of arrhythmia or alarm. EKGs -8972730672.63 0
remained unchanged from baseline , except there was a prolongation -6.90603108001e+13 0
of QTC with the initiation of Zyprexa , which was stopped. The 8391743.78391 1
patient's heart rate remained stable in the 50s-60s on his -273338868.353 0
cardiac regimen. -41100608929.7 0
4. Renal: The patient has end stage renal disease on 845988.655524 1
hemodialysis and was apparently incompletely dialyzed on the day -1.66500758785e+16 0
prior to admission. Due to chest pain , it was initially -2193410.54539 0
difficult to have the patient complete a course of hemodialysis 3.39323546695e+12 1
but over his hospital stay he was dialyzed effectively. He has -4292986844.14 0
arrangements to follow up with his outpatient hemodialysis after 1.06475876731e+16 1
discharge -4.21329504936e+35 0
5. Psychiatry: After ruling out for myocardial infarction , -62165061540.6 0
plans were being made to discharge the patient home and the -711565733.758 0
patient's family was called. They reported concern that did not -14632534092.5 0
want the patient to return home because of abusive and erratic -4392362238.48 0
behavior by the patient. They reported that actually in the -35963886972.5 0
setting of the patient's fall , the police were called and when -8279220.76537 0
they arrived the patient complained of chest pain and was brought -59570947345.3 0
to the hospital by ambulance. There was a history of restraining -17761545153.3 0
or taking out by the wife against the patient , and she reported -6792601.68691 0
feeling unsafe with him from the home. Psychiatry did see the -2116758531.1 0
patient and felt that he was unreliable and was probably not safe -738300012.001 0
to go home to take care of himself , but that he was also 649.127528419 1
confident to make decisions and was not acutely psychotic , and -11676785038.4 0
therefore , it should not be committed against his will. The -460785704.814 0
patient denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. The patient -3.06568312352e+15 0
was started on SSRI and initially on Zyprexa though this was -513389262.872 0
stopped because of prolonged QTC. After a few days , the patient' -27209703.4021 0
family changed their mind and decided that they would be okay -1907310076.99 0
with him coming home. The situation was discussed with the -16155492437.6 0
patient's primary doctor , with the family over the phone , as they 1136802.61077 1
would not come in for a family meeting with the patient and he 311309.951084 1
did go home , but will likely require a psych follow up as an 8903.37862377 1
outpatient. -6.17596454935e+12 0
6. Endocrine: The patient continued on insulin and Regular -32755032676.3 0
Insulin sliding scale for his history of diabetes. 4601942640.98 1
7. Infectious disease: The patient developed a low blood -7196875560.71 0
pressure and was noted to have erythema and pus from the site of -10645760.4586 0
his hemodialysis catheter in the right subclavian position. He 6.63952712784e+14 1
became fully hypertensive and required a brief course of pressors -2.26328098143e+13 0
to maintain blood pressure. The catheter was removed and -1.90799251102e+12 0
cultures were obtained that demonstrated methicillin-resistant -1.52156622009e+39 0
Staph aureus. The patient was treated with vancomycin and -2.55156840491e+12 0
gentamicin dose to his renal function and showed improvement in -1.80775759394e+12 0
his symptoms in clearance of his bacteremia. The gentamicin was -5.27987608466e+11 0
stopped and plans were made for the patient to receive vancomycin -17020156525.2 0
as an outpatient and hemodialysis in follow up. He was dialyzed 23881458533.6 1
from VAF fistula in his arm that had been created a number of 484648.658739 1
months prior to this admission. -457221202.632 0
8. Nutrition: The patient was seen by nutrition and was given a -11453888.5325 0
renal carbohydrate controlled low fat low cholesterol diet. He -2.31690471276e+15 0
was continued on Nephrocaps. B12 and folate were normal. -9567357902.0 0

to the right lower extremity. Hip flexors is based on the relative -1312259820.63 0
difficulty with heel to shin on the right. Old findings on exam 225938718.225 1
included abnormalities of the right eye muscles , decreased left -7.08516635246e+12 0
palpebral fissure and sensory findings in the left lower -1.63181055996e+12 0
extremities as well as reflexes. Her presentation was consistent -2.29909651556e+16 0
with possible small vessel stroke affecting the arm and leg more -20680556417.0 0
than the face. This could have occurred in the pons area or the -5808030.8417 0
internal capsule. The component of confusion however is less -1.57107063023e+14 0
explainable based on a deep lesion such as this and raised the -121914835.685 0
possibility of a small cortical insult. MRI showed no territorial -2.32036000398e+13 0
stroke , just T2 intense abnormalities in the periventricular white -2.44656306099e+14 0
matter , corona radiata and centrum semiovalle suggestive of small -9.88818879294e+13 0
vessel disease. Echo and Holter were not suggestive of -1.34331804184e+11 0
cardioembolic disease. Echo showed normal LV size , preserved LV -7.36336607334e+12 0
function with estimated ejection fraction of 80%. There is also -217941055.061 0
mild LVH , no thrombus was seen. There was aortic sclerosis with -163741103.826 0
mildly regurgitation , mild thickening of the mitral valve leaflets -2.12769207715e+14 0
with mild mitral regurgitation and bubble study was negative. -9.24333221061e+11 0
Holter was sinus rhythm at 54 to 127 beats per minute. Occasional 98182151.5075 1
frequent APB's , 14 atrial couplets , five runs of SVT ranging from 3 1746170.93428 1
to 10 beats with heart rates 108 to 182 , occasionally only frequent -1868776.2499 0
VPB's at all hours and one ventricular couplet. Carotid -3004759970.88 0
noninvasive studies showed no significant hemodynamic lesions. Of -6.3582067311e+22 0
note on the MRI , the basilar artery appeared to be small caliber -19051668.1888 0
and the carotid showed some calcification. On carotid noninvasive -2.00498979567e+17 0
studies , however , there was only minimal plaque in the carotid -180285123.212 0
arteries. 217935155.133 1
In summary , it appears that Ms. Epperly had a small vessel stroke. 206049.955866 1
She showed some critical improvement during hospital stay and was -2.61050206504e+13 0
able to walk without assistance on the second hospital day. She -6041144675.16 0
also had improved right hand function and appeared to be less -2155537124.72 0
confused. We recommended starting enteric coated aspirin which she -3.38778316916e+17 0
is to take one per day. In the setting of the acute stroke , we did 10260.5543646 1
not control her blood pressure aggressively. Her pressures ranged -9.56362616727e+16 0
from systolics of 120 to 180 averaging around 140 to 150 with 8111061.50732 1
diastolics usually in the 80's. We have suggested that she -11960816875.4 0
discontinue the use of her Reserpine as intermittent use is -27429524015.3 0
problematic especially with this medication and she admits to -8.14281483722e+14 0
intermittent use as well as the fact that she has suffered from -86618570.0978 0
some mild depression that can be associated with Reserpine. She -2.1868519286e+12 0
will be started on an alternative blood pressure as an out-patient -51906736489.1 0
with Dr. Scotton in the next week. We did not wish to start this 106704.506946 1
medication in the acute setting. She will likely be started on an -617465586.213 0
Ace inhibitor for blood pressure control. We also suggested that -6.72936945559e+12 0
she discontinue the use of Phenobarbital for sleep as this might 3380096225.66 1
contribute to confusion. -6.17596454935e+12 0
Finally , since she is on Prednisone and Mestinon , we asked the 21096983.1199 1
patient whether she was taking GI prophylaxis. Evidently , she only -1.84451983423e+11 0
does this intermittently as well. She may be on Carefate , however , -60322069.9071 0
we suggested taking an H2 blocker once in the evening and have -98401316.1013 0
provided her with the prescription for Zantac 150 mg q h.s. She 105199496.055 1
will follow-up with Dr. Milosch , her primary doctor at Ni Health as well as Dr. Salmen at the Ont Hospital 7839478.27011 1
for her myasthenia gravis and stroke. She has an appointment with -45706913309.1 0

ATTENDING: RAYMUNDO RODRIUEZ MD -3.01883402227e+13 0
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of chronic -1230480680.47 0
obstructive pulmonary disease with the last FEV1 of 0.42 , -12221871086.3 0
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of approximately -7.40877441316e+21 0
40% , who was transferred from Bradpark Hospital for continued -6651682319.68 0
treatment for worsening shortness of breath. The patient reports -3.63507929663e+16 0
that one week prior to her admission to the Daspe I Health , 873369.802381 1
two days before transfer to the Ordma Medical Center , the -112338744.468 0
patient felt more dyspneic on exertion. She noted that she is -1356390166.32 0
having a hard time even getting to the bathroom. Ordinarily , at -309659980.998 0
home , her baseline using 1.5 liters of oxygen at rest , but able 1019533.34266 1
to get around the house and upstairs. She went to Lahorn Mulg Medical Center on Sunday. She reports that she had a dry cough without -84235783.6103 0
any sputum production. No fever or chills. No sick contacts. -771674052.403 0
No hemoptysis. No runny nose or sore throat. This is different -2334918639.55 0
from her usual COPD excerebration , in which it is no longer -10403831.0448 0
proceeded by symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. -2.00256059256e+12 0
In addition , the history reveals that the patient usually uses -9985611539.1 0
two pillows to sleep , but recently had been using two pillows -60724146.4483 0
folded and felt short of breath if she lay down more than that. 8459.94995115 1
She would wakeup in the middle of the night when she was short of 247318.893475 1
breath , but there was no change in that symptom over the previous -39464388.9754 0
months. 423000.536183 1
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient has gained 15 pounds in one year 229977.467959 1
prior to admission. She believes that it was due to previous -518793719.05 0
steroid use. She also notes that she had some diarrhea that was -146105979.281 0
"like pudding" 1-3 times per day. Not watery , not bloody , and 429615.406378 1
not black. No recent antibiotic use. -59130850.3284 0

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Temperature was 96.4 degrees -2.14663897246e+13 0
Fahrenheit , heart rate was 120 and regular , blood pressure was -151070016.214 0
142/60 , respiratory rate was 24 , and sating 95% on 2 liters of 102268.412393 1
nasal cannula. General: The patient was talking 2-3 words at a -136857500.829 0
time. She cannot speak in full sentences. She is using -7841506.38919 0
accessory muscles for breathing. Her jugular venous pressure was -1.79407221686e+16 0
elevated , but with significant respiratory phasic variation. The -1.43831106457e+17 0
patient's hand veins also revealed an increased venous pressure. -74193221900.2 0
The patient had no pallor and no jaundice. Her extraocular -31096683998.4 0
motions were intact. Her pupils were equal and reactive to -15458917639.1 0
light. The patient's oropharynx revealed thrush on the tongue. -16327963193.7 0
Chest exam: There were decreased breath sounds. They were soft -6119033107.92 0
and expiratory wheezes at the bases. No crackles and no rhonchi. -819224689.954 0
Cardiovascularly , the rhythm was regular , tachycardiac , with a -29257763997.1 0
1-2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. The abdomen was soft , , -1644972.18836 0
nontender , and nondistended. There were bowel sounds. -4.3642353202e+11 0
Extremities: There was no edema , nontender. Symmetric -2.89588016168e+11 0
extremities. No clubbing. -1.60495062497e+14 0
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband of 43 years. -990123.223295 0
They have no children. The patient has not used tobacco since -1734827394.52 0
1984. She has occasional alcohol use. She notes that she drinks -6331636649.3 0
one drink every month approximately. -1.00198095672e+12 0
At the outside hospital the patient's labs were as follows. Her -199247911.228 0
white count was 12 with 75% neutrophils , 3 eosinophils , and 6-12 2676296.68148 1
bands forms. Hematocrit was 45. Her platelet count was 290 , 000. 10267023.918 1
Her PTT was 42. Her INR was 2.2. Her Chem-7 and her sodium was 112994.196624 1
139. Her potassium was 4.5. Her chloride 101 and bicarbonate -79804176231.7 0
was 31 and BUN was 20. Her creatine was 1.1. Her glucose was 569357.169928 1
118. Her total protein was 7.7 with an albumin of 4.2 , AST of 227436.345128 1
29 , ALT of 43 , and alkaline phosphatase of 104. Total bilirubin 12196063.0295 1
is 0.3. Her pH was 7.38 with the carbon dioxide of 54 and an 42641.8951054 1
oxygen of 37 on 20% FiO2 , which is ambient air. This was noted 45133.4440835 1
to be an arterial blood gas. Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia at -163741103.826 0
120 beats per minutes. QRS width was approximately 120 -70440913954.2 0
milliseconds in a left bundle branch pattern with normal axis. -2657890212.64 0
No left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage. She had 1-2 mm -14096110866.1 0
ST-depression in 2 , 3 and AVF with T-wave inversions in those -37461237.6388 0
leads , also T-wave inversions with 1 mm ST depression in V5 and 7890878.62554 1
V6. The only change from the March , 2004 , EKG is that of 28235.9852045 1
T-wave inversion in V5 , otherwise stable. -264826496.862 0
IMPRESSION: At the time of admission , the patient was thought to -22121274.0629 0
be a 60-year-old woman with severe COPD and CHF , who presented -156244394.477 0
with worsening shortness of breath consistent with a COPD -3.8932703628e+12 0
excerebration. However , this was unlike many of her previous -1.71793700151e+11 0
exacerbations in that she did not experience any upper -1.01190571105e+11 0
respiratory tract infection , and in addition , her jugular venous -43447688393.1 0
pressure was elevated , so it was considered that she might be -52191892.1984 0
having a congestive heart failure exacerbation , as well. -12305836817.5 0
1. Pulmonary: The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation , -3079316902.83 0
with prednisone 60 mg by mouth each morning , Atrovent and 77019426.1033 1
albuterol nebulizers q.4h. and albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers -1.31974417545e+22 0
as needed. She was also continued on levofloxacin. Initially , 5015118626.68 1
the patient received 500 mg of levofloxacin a day. As her renal 31408554.6633 1
function worsened that was changed to 150 mg a day and when her -1834176.40109 0
renal function improved again her levofloxacin was once again -4.15312616168e+14 0
increased to 500 mg a day. This should be continued for a 10-day -7832952.71018 0
course. There is little concern for pulmonary embolism , given -6.15131880246e+11 0
the patient's elevated INR. However , she did have a decreased O2 -39880900.6492 0
saturation and her CO2 was not very elevated at the outside -419729402.311 0
hospital. A D-dimer was sent which was less than 200 , which is -6407964.18531 0
negative , suggestive very highly for a pulmonary embolism. The -1.92218555216e+12 0
patient's pulmonary status improved throughout her stay , and by -41481949400.8 0
March , 2004 , she was sating in the 90% range on 2 liters nasal 12818.747536 1
cannula , almost at baseline. It was thought by the physical -710094139.18 0
therapy that the patient would benefit from further pulmonary -6.54491136326e+14 0
rehabilitation. As this dictation is being done , the plan is for -697331855.011 0
her either to go to pulmonary rehabilitation or to stay at the -67103968.5904 0
hospital until she is fully ready and safe to go home , and is not 46454.1701937 1
at an increased fall risk given her severe osteoporosis. -5947301385.92 0
2. Cardiovascular: -1.67746887483e+31 0
A. Pump: Initially , the patient was thought to possibly be -10350077.4594 0
volume overloaded given the fact that she was not taking her -871692355.821 0
Lasix and that her JVP appeared elevated. In addition , there was 578667997.535 1
some question whether she might has been having increasing -1.42722469616e+13 0
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or at least orthopnea. She was -5.93817580886e+13 0
initially diuresed aggressively with 60 mg of IV Lasix , two 792918386.52 1
times. However , lab results suggested that congestive heart -1.59131091124e+14 0
failure was not a large part of her presentation. First , the -26538580.3893 0
brain natriuretic peptide that was sent , showed a value of -524198249.749 0
proximally 134 , which is approximately a baseline of 141 , -338211822.622 0
suggesting that she was not having an acute exacerbation of her -5495141960.12 0
heart failure. In addition , the patient's creatinine increased -7.70139249311e+12 0
from her outside hospital value of 1.0. When it was first -24595227.8911 0
checked at 1:00 in the morning on March , 2004 , at Clinchau Hospital , it was 1.7. She received her two doses of 1083053.61958 1
Lasix , one on the night of June , 2004 , and then again in the 12550.3277468 1
morning of March , 2004. Her creatinine in the afternoon of January , 2004 , increased to 2.2. Urine electrolytes were sent and the -498671637.385 0
acute renal failure workup will be discussed below under the -77122458728.6 0
renal section. In terms of her heart failure , the patient was -13410206.881 0
given IV fluids and did not have any further symptoms of heart -81688134.0916 0
failure. Her normal dose of 40 mg of Lasix p.o. every morning 84341843.3512 1
was restarted on July , 2004 , and she will be continued on that -30211.805796 0
dose. 1043.42980562 1
B. Rhythm: The patient was monitored on telemetry and after her -264398275.622 0
sinus tachycardia her heart rate came down as her hyperoxemia -2.32249222664e+11 0
improved and she had no further issues. -32230245.0095 0
C. Ischemia: The patient was continued on aspirin HMG-COA -13952036620.5 0
reductase inhibitor. She was continued on her folic acid , as -245088046.313 0
well. She was not put on a beta-blocker given her bronchospastic -15175364309.6 0
response to that , but she was continued on her angiotensin -413846489.608 0
receptor blocker after her acute renal failure resolved. -3.24532389235e+12 0
3. Renal: The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.0 -11829840.5025 0
from the outside hospital and 1.71 when she first presented. Her -18857261192.8 0
baseline is in the low 1's; 1.0-1.5 as her baseline. The peak 354069.690991 1
creatinine during her stay was March , 2004 , at 5:00 p.m. and it 1185689.84814 1
was 2.2. Her BUN at that time was 55. Urine electrolytes were -35907432.0654 0
sent , which showed a urine sodium of 39 , and creatinine of 137 , 164578.139863 1
and that was only 12 hours after the patient got her last dose of -12554.3790608 0
Lasix. It was felt that the patient had prerenal azotemia and 12261134.4261 1
was given IV fluids. Her creatinine improved , and on March , -13945180.9101 0
2004 , the patient's creatinine was 1.3 , approximately her -589894156.93 0
baseline. Her BUN at that time was 30 , increased from 23 on May , 2004. The patient will be monitored as an outpatient to make -1032482.45855 0
sure that her Lasix dose is not too high. 89203.6248644 1
4. Musculoskeletal: The patient's creatine kinase was elevated -3.85285785557e+12 0
on admission to 574. It was rechecked on May , 2004 , and it 66529.5905182 1
was 1967. It was felt that this was due to two factors. -29173.4659309 0
Increased release from the muscle , as the patient's MB-fraction -35843918791.8 0
was only 33.5 , which was less than 5% and the troponin was -3559.9476902 0
negative. So this was felt to be due to her increased work of -843737.164145 0
breathing and release from the muscle and exacerbated by her -1.75272164274e+11 0
acute renal failure and retention of the creatine kinase. Her -1.22120076214e+11 0
creatine kinase decreased by August , 2004 , to 1195. Therefore , 276450841.383 1
it was not felt that the patient had rhabdomyolysis causing renal -30448066516.5 0
failure , but rather renal failure causing retention of creatine -5.77766742389e+12 0
kinase disease from increased work of breathing. -4.32132920413e+11 0
5. Hematology: The patient was continued on her Coumadin. The -1607503194.38 0
patient's INR throughout her stay remained therapeutic between -6.63399249861e+15 0
2.4 and 2.6. On March , 2004 , it was 2.5. She was continued on 16084.0368641 1
her home dose. The patient's white blood cell count was elevated 28972495.2269 1
at admission at the outside hospital with a left shift. She was -90440183.8528 0
started on levofloxacin and steroids. Therefore , it is difficult -1.70633685954e+13 0
to interpret her white count deferential. Her white count -3.63007706503e+12 0
remained elevated between 15 and 20 throughout her stay. Her -1.27959462161e+11 0
neutrophil count remained between 70 and 78% of that. A -17243505.5347 0
urinalysis was sent , which did not suggest that the patient had a -51789286.7799 0
urinary tract infection. -7.52215165032e+12 0
6. The patient's TSH was 0.46 with a normal T4 of 7.8. She will 65692.0420992 1
be followed up as an outpatient , as this may represent -16303422.6793 0
subclinical hyperthyroidism. In addition to her thyroid , the -6.78085096977e+14 0
patient's osteoporosis was continued to be treated with calcium -7.98612199015e+12 0
carbonate , vitamin D , and Fosamax during her stay. 10084605.5075 1
7. Rheumatology: The patient was continued on her probenecid -63706349782.2 0
250 mg two times a day. She has no symptoms of gout. 24629.0273434 1
8. Psychiatry: The patient was continued on her clonazepam and -4420416450.44 0
Celexa. She was not continued on Ritalin and will not be 25063876.7488 1
discharged on her Ritalin given her tachycardia. In addition , 2.14153820447e+11 1
the patient did not feel that the Ritalin was helping her. -2370437.2824 0
9. Pain. The patient's Vioxx was discontinued because of her 490509564.772 1
renal issues. This will also not be one of her discharge 1913551.67175 1
medications and it should be reassessed by her primary care -46064780627.6 0
doctor. The benefits may outweigh the risks , but this should be -465602371.903 0
up to Dr. Satterfield , who has a long-term relationship with the -566311532.579 0
patient. 12165108.9239 1
10. Infectious disease: The patient had blood cultures sent , -3133629792.27 0
which were negative. At admission , in addition , her urinalysis -12805354743.7 0
showed many red blood cells. It did have some white blood cells -185640791.358 0
and leucocyte esterase. This is most likely just because the -1.15440950107e+11 0
patient had bleeding , secondary to her Foley catheter. -1913774548.37 0
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Please use the patient's discharge sheet -2.94606091077e+13 0

was placed on H. pylori treatment with amoxicillin , 4082347009.3 1
clarithromycin , and Nexium twice daily; and in reaction to this , 39306176.2187 1
he had mild elevation of his liver function tests. -1384452.24733 0
BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL: Mr. Blackmer is A&amp;O x3 with a BP of 34525.7018125 1
90/60 , heart rate of 84. His lungs are bilaterally clear. His 36789441.6411 1
heart exam shows a regular S1 , S2. Faint S3 with a 1/6 54916.6558021 1
holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex with a JVD of 12 cm 372127.218034 1
plus V waves. His abdomen is benign. Extremities show no edema , 75953230.5758 1
but a left lower extremity petechial rash. He is found to be -21538305.968 0
heme positive with tarry stool , and he has a stable stage 4 330470.722389 1
sacral decubitus ulcer , well granulated without clear evidence of -6.04370282125e+13 0
infection. -8376732062.65 0
Admission labs are significant for creatinine of 3.6 , BUN of 239 , 3101305.54654 1
potassium of 5.8 , digoxin of 1.7 , hematocrit of 29.3 , INR 4.1. 379189.618441 1

HOSPPITAL COURSE: -8.79280149212e+27 0
1. Mr. Kristin presented with acute and chronic renal failure -3.21955035199e+11 0
with baseline BUN and creatinine at approximately 66/2.4 with a -2.87025385524e+12 0
rapid rise between presentation and the last noted value on -48159147698.0 0
9/24/2005. Although , he was asymptomatic and did not have any -3581654979.33 0
EKG changes , he was treated with Kayexalate and sodium -708271469.489 0
bicarbonate which resulted in rapid normalization of potassium. -3.14607443135e+16 0
The superelevation of his BUN was thought in part to be due to -625669.540328 0
possible over diuresis but also complicated by the fact that he -9181706526.61 0
had Hemoccult positive stool as suspicious for a GI bleed as a -82442086.5624 0
source of increased nitrogen. The renal service was consulted -5.38702877473e+14 0
and initial treatment of his acute renal failure included the -3.22303128561e+11 0
above plus removal of all fluid restriction and diuresis in order -45004375949.1 0
to reverse any potential prerenal state. Essentially , all urine -6.43577939205e+12 0
and renal studies including eosinophils and renal ultrasound were -1.88520474011e+17 0
negative with a renal ultrasound showing normal kidneys without -1.04605685249e+16 0
hydronephrosis but without increased resistance in the feet -1.22526548908e+18 0
bilaterally. At the time of discharge , his creatinine and BUN -2916661765.87 0
had fallen to 1.9/81 respectively and remained stable over days. -42805953074.5 0
The initial renal diet restrictions imposed during the -6.64505185298e+14 0
hospitalization were removed towards the end of the stay with -2.60164022035e+11 0
persistently stable values as well. -1.31215933617e+11 0
2. From a cardiovascular standpoint , a repeat echo on 2/25 -379117737.47 0
showed an EF of 35 to 40 with inferior wall and inferior septal -556845.885583 0
severe hypo to akinesis as well as posterior wall severe -1743844253.16 0
hypokinesis with trace aortic insufficiency , 1+ mitral valve -6.13662992937e+14 0
regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid valve regurgitation but normal left -3.80946271385e+16 0
ventricular size and thickness as well as normal right -1.27541437261e+11 0
ventricular size function. In order to better assess his filling -7.12495821979e+12 0
pressures and fluid status and attempt to optimize his renal -1.75161015688e+11 0
function , Mr. Marthaler underwent a right heart cath with PA line 136368972.175 1
placement on 9/12/2005 which revealed elevating filling -8.58463418137e+20 0
pressures including right atrium at 26 to 27 , right ventricle -2008688435.92 0
65/13 , PA 64/32 , wedge 36. Pulmonary artery sat 39% , SVR 1568 , 69186.006414 1
and pulmonary vascular resistance 221. His cardiac output and -8.91767653887e+14 0
index were both reduced. The PA line was left in for tailor -3906014.91983 0
therapy , and he was initially placed on nesiritide drip at 0.005 -421443516.055 0
as well as a Lasix drip with good urine output and increase in 1303592.81017 1
his cardiac output and index and decrease in his elevated -10802184937.6 0
systemic vascular resistance. On 2/17/2005 , the nesiritide drip -3.39854487649e+16 0
was discontinued and Lasix continued with the addition of -4.63106653911e+12 0
short-acting nitrates in the form of Isordil. Eventually , he was -28499765989.0 0
transferred from the Lasix drip to torsemide reaching optimal -4.84815559669e+14 0
dose of 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. on 1/13/2005 , and further tailoring 73526558.6452 1
with Imdur 30 and hydralazine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for further 627413224.042 1
afterload reduction were preformed. Lisinopril previously used -4.64198631189e+27 0
on admission was continuously held given the recent acute renal -1.68725087132e+12 0
failure. 12165108.9239 1
3. From an ischemic standpoint , there were no active issues -896455858.399 0
during the hospitalization. His beta blocker was reduced to 12.5 -6.50983319767e+12 0
briefly , but his normal dose of 25 once a day was resumed prior 279961.161783 1
to discharge. In terms of his rate , it was well controlled on 1923351.5482 1
the above regimen , but his rhythm showed frequent ectopy without -45706913309.1 0
response to diuresis or beta blockade. He does have an ICD in -15281452.8188 0
place which never fired during the course of the hospitalization. -83600246248.1 0
Upon discharge , he was close to euvolemia with an approximate -3004989890.53 0
discharge weight of 67.6 kg. 3422928.28329 1
4. From a GI standpoint , his initial presentation included -29063540336.7 0
heme-positive tarry stools with elevated BUN. He was seen by the -14454112824.1 0
GI service and underwent a colonscopy and upper EGD which were -6222376121.76 0
significant for gastritis without signs of active bleeding as -5.95061418606e+14 0
well as internal hemorrhoids. H. pylori serologies were -1.79519605542e+15 0
positive , and he was initially started on clarithromycin , -28061840013.6 0
amoxicillin , and Nexium b.i.d. , but this regimen was changed to 229157580.688 1
amoxicillin , Flagyl , and Nexium b.i.d. given an elevation of his 2049911423.03 1
LFTs on the prior regimen. There was no overt GI bleeding , and -1540423.08439 0
he tolerated the procedure without complication. -1.24999912577e+16 0
5. From a nutrition standpoint , Mr. Splatt was seen by a -532912.794579 0
nutrition specialist who confirmed suspicion of suboptimal -6.23974824349e+23 0
caloric intake meeting his total caloric needs about only 60% and -567840024.082 0
total protein needs are 85% despite labilization of his diet and -415516181.782 0
the addition of Megace. His nutritional goals were even more -49209252127.4 0
important given his large stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer with -2.02617817706e+11 0
poor healing since March 2005. Despite encouragement and the -2.56573121004e+14 0
addition of appetite stimulants with vitamin C , zinc , mineral , -47028345.0404 0
multivitamins , and the addition of supplements , he presently fell -1.78918642256e+11 0
short of his goals but refused other means of diet -11725160.6756 0
supplementation including NG tube placement and PEG placement and -1.94735663199e+17 0
is determined to provide adequate p.o. intake by mouth. He and -3061670288.01 0
his family met with a registered dietitian and understand the -3.419792627e+11 0
importance of his caloric intakes. -21238622034.5 0
6. From a musculoskeletal point of view , he has stage 4 sacral 484382.277632 1
decubitus ulcer which is followed by plastic surgery and -1.4579948882e+12 0
frequently debrided as an outpatient , Dr. Bastress and his team , -1042756843.37 0
followed the patient while inhouse , and it was treated as per -71011719.5286 0
protocol with b.i.d. dressing changes with Panafil and wet-to-dry -1.1977985605e+17 0
dressings. Initially , he was started on Keflex for suspicion of -1786493531.0 0
infection in the wound , and this was changed to vancomycin given -850501426.509 0
MRSA growth in the wound and further Klebsiella growth which was -24464065608.3 0
treated with levofloxacin , but these were all discontinued on -7.04025351611e+11 0
2/17/2005 as per plastic recommendations given the high -2.96333253603e+15 0
probability colonization. It was also felt that these -1.18584798744e+14 0
antibiotics would provide appropriate coverage for the possible -1.18891519018e+21 0
right lower lobe infiltrate questioned on x-ray. -3.41793353453e+11 0
7. From an endocrinology standpoint , he has a history of diabetes -1067032855.24 0
type 2 , and he was continued on his Lantus and NovoLog insulin 3068337.92414 1
sliding scale with titration of optimal glucose control in order -6.41394888688e+12 0
to promote wound healing. He was followed by the diabetes -7453361322.63 0
management team. 9595563731.51 1
8. From rheumatologic standpoint , he has a history of gout , and -4838553.61542 0
he was maintained on allopurinol , renal dosing , but colchicine 2476932183.69 1
helps. On about 10/9/2005 , he developed symptoms of podagra , -1479714760.21 0
and a prednisone taper starting at 15 mg was started with quick -167308406.39 0
resolution of symptoms. -2.74313615879e+11 0
9. From hematologic standpoint , he has anemia baseline and takes -46860513858.8 0
Procrit once a week as an outpatient. He received 1 unit of -1810576.4135 0
packed red blood cell transfusion on 1/24 and maintained his -1.49665102978e+11 0
hematocrit throughout the remainder of the hospitalization. He -2.13073853296e+20 0
was also maintained on darbepoetin as an inpatient. -9245780978.02 0
Laboratory data showed no evidence of hemolysis with a normal -2.44584785435e+11 0
haptoglobin and LDH , but evidence of decreased iron saturation. -42449552086.1 0
He was started on iron supplementation , and his Coumadin was held -524817335.98 0

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: -4.88582610016e+15 0
This is a 49-year-old woman with a recent ICU stay at an outside -13879832.8691 0
hospital who presented with hypotension , tachycardia , and acute -2.07023332449e+13 0
renal failure. Presentation was most consistent with right -2.39539386538e+17 0
pulmonary embolus and right ventricular failure. -1.61880559431e+16 0
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM: -2.93154238718e+14 0
1. Pulmonary/Vascular: There was initial concern for a PE given -11982879361.9 0
the presentation of severe hypotension , tachycardia , and Aa -2.04759383133e+11 0
gradient without evidence of infection or primary cardiac -5.22060092075e+16 0
disease. An echo showed a dilated RV with depressed RV function -7955318076.93 0
suggestive of PE. Her initial PE scan was nondiagnostic -3.26559774035e+11 0
secondary to poorly timed contrast and motion of the patient. A -10973020744.1 0
VQ scan showed intermediate probability. She was started on -5.35985596648e+13 0
heparin drip with a goal of 60 to 80. Her second PECT showed a 245788.995594 1
small PE to the right upper lobe , but it was not large enough to 96227.9587571 1
explain her dramatic presentation. The working hypothesis is -5.60900872394e+18 0
that there was a significant recanalization prior to this repeat -6.13842907895e+12 0
CT which took place two days after the first CT. She was -452210.993575 0
initially on oxygen in the ICU. She was never intubated. She -385851822.569 0
was on face mask , and upon transfer to the floor , she was on 18686.008098 1
nasal cannula 4 liters. Her O2 saturations were acceptable -1.54964341827e+13 0
in-house , although she did desaturate to 90% when she took her 2291109.47849 1
oxygen off a night. She multiple times refused BiPAP while in -585070139.801 0
the hospital , but she will go back on it when she returns home. 83937.9526301 1
2. Cardiovascular: She had a mild troponin elevation on -2370819867.88 0
admission , likely secondary to RV strain. She had severe -3881883924.24 0
hypotension and was on two pressors. She was weaned off of these -323225416.615 0
on 4/15/06 , but did have an episode of hypotension when her -7824619.77756 0
BiPAP was started. She was given a little bit of low dose -1214935.53555 0
dobutamine and then she was weaned off of that on 3/6/06. 1773427.61292 1
Rhythm: She has no active issues. We continued to hold her -5578594.80629 0
lisinopril while in-house. Her blood pressures were stable , but -2.28704554701e+12 0
not high enough to withstand on additional blood pressure -2.91882478885e+12 0
lowering medication. It was discussed with her PCP that she -37528071763.5 0
perhaps will need this medication restarted as an outpatient. -5.53352089779e+11 0
She does have a history of severe hypertension. -350088528.189 0
3. Renal: As she was in acute failure on admission with a 274034.268645 1
creatinine of 6.9 , it dropped to 0.5 , most likely this was due to 192174.776765 1
prerenal azotemia and decreased renal perfusion in the setting of -2.6422278013e+13 0
hypotension. Hypoperfusion of the kidneys in setting of -2.17090978353e+15 0
hypovolemia and right heart failure resulting in decreased left -8.85554113348e+15 0
ventricular preload. Mucomyst and bicarb were given prior to the -8.25431701346e+12 0
PECTs of her renal protection. She did not develop any -524414473.757 0
additional contrast nephropathy after her CT scans. Her -2.34090398046e+15 0
creatinine on discharge was 0.6. -1183049346.32 0
4. Endocrine: She had a normal increase in her cortisol level -29017147.655 0
with ACTH stimulation. Her fingersticks were monitored while she -2.60079854051e+16 0
was in-house and she never had any need for supplemental insulin. -1281343407.39 0
5. FEN: She was on a house diet. 629.895072972 1
6. ID: She was empirically covered on admission with -108456476.309 0
vancomycin , levofloxacin and gentamicin. Her antibiotics were -1.19759003298e+20 0
given again on 10/16/06 and on 11/13/06. There was no evidence -4214847391.14 0
of an infection found , no fever , normal white count , with a 167403.364356 1
normal differential , normal UA , chest x-ray is without -1848789193.15 0
infiltrate , and antibiotics were discontinued on 4/21/06. She -2.45148766596e+15 0
continued to remain afebrile in-house without any evidence of -6.28995509062e+14 0
infection. -8376732062.65 0
7. Urology: She did complain of bladder spasms while having the -124256147.559 0
Foley in place. She was started on Ditropan. She had multiple -1142649257.17 0
negative urinalysis and urine cultures. Once the Foley was -2.05889010879e+13 0
discontinued , she was able to void and she stopped having bladder -705264720.721 0
spasms. She was started on Monistat for a yeast infection. -112771308.384 0
8. Allergy: She did have an elevated eosinophilia on -242353491.834 0
presentation and it was 4% on admission and increased to 8% on 448926.910858 1
4/21/06. On the day of discharge , it was 7.5. There is no 148343.095623 1
clinical evidence of allergy , rheumatic disease or parasitic -8.00046156153e+14 0
infection. Her obstructive lung disease may be of an asthma -28699149913.6 0
variant , and there is the possibility she may need inhaled -473568661.314 0
corticosteroids as an outpatient. -2.67774837629e+15 0
9. Heme: She was on unfractionated heparin for her presumed PE 63186936.5459 1
until 6/15/06 and then she was changed to Lovenox in the morning -35343979.3786 0
of that day on 120 mg subq. Her weight at that time was 157 kg. 14680.2015597 1
Her Coumadin , her initially given 10 , then a dose of 5 and then 2 49145.456159 1
dose of 7.5. Her INR was therapeutic on the day of discharge at 1530688.28711 1
2.5. She will continue on the Lovenox for two additional days. 38214868.3414 1
Her INR will be monitored by Dr. Kid , her PCP. 6849.8324877 1
10. Psych/Addiction: We are continuing her methadone. It has -1.49680826434e+11 0
been switched from 20 mg p.o. daily to 10 mg p.o. b.i.d. She was 650712.578591 1
also given a little bit of Ativan while in-house to help with her 2456367.27621 1
agitation and anxiety. She was initially given a little bit of -4527917821.19 0
Haldol , but that was discontinued on 8/4/06 and there was no -22541984.4251 0
additional need for that. She did have a central line placed on -170540894.969 0
4/18/06 , which was discontinued on 6/15/06 without any evidence -5.74327484775e+12 0
of any line infection and without any problems. She was seen by -178577010.572 0

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: 1. Cardiovascular - ischemia. The -5.63404117788e+11 0
patient ruled out for MI by CKs but 217597.081078 1
had a troponin which peaked at 0.12. This was thought to be rate -12870965.2044 0
related. Blood pressure control was established with verapamil -1.80982755272e+20 0
( The patient had severe bronchospasms to Lopressor and it was -4606477830.66 0
unclear whether it was cardiac asthma or real bronchospastic -2.03462738118e+14 0
reaction. ) , clonidine , and losartan. ( The patient had cough and 67077130.6763 1
desaturation to captopril. ) Aspirin was given. A lipid panel was 60649829703.5 1
checked and showed a total cholesterol of 188 , LDL 130 , HDL 56 and 257662.933459 1
triglycerides of 63. The patient was initially continued on -3.72170363123e+13 0
simvastatin. Because of the worry of CHF , ( History of low EF , 1085327.31884 1
possible orthopnea ) an echocardiogram was performed which showed -1.88064600406e+17 0
LVEF only 25% with global hypokinesis and inferior/posterior -7.5141697104e+14 0
akinesis. The etiology of his heart failure was unclear as he had -442164183.29 0
never had a known myocardial infarction in the past. A chemical -7591440615.73 0
stress test was performed on November , 2003 , and showed no -14170823.9271 0
reversible defect but a large inferior scar. The patient was -1.42324900229e+11 0
subsequently taken to cardiac catheterization to determine whether -5.8211805423e+22 0
he had coronary artery disease. There was no coronary artery -88799023012.5 0
disease on left heart cath. Right heart cath showed an elevated -4716158503.93 0
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure close to 30 and a central venous -1.6575436446e+11 0
pressure of 18. His cardiomyopathy was not shown to be ischemic in -788783964.602 0
origin. There was no indication seen for AICD placement. However , -80649818841.4 0
for the elevated central pressures , the patient was aggressively -1.94691568303e+13 0
diuresed with IV Lasix which was then changed to p.o. torsemide. 599621030.432 1
Aspirin and simvastatin were discontinued given lack of coronary -2.25900870535e+16 0
artery disease for the sake of simplifying his medical regimen in -28499765989.0 0
order to optimize the chance of medical compliance. -11605013741.3 0
2. Pulmonary. The patient was given levofloxacin for -1.96210617108e+13 0
community-acquired pneumonia and improved. On the evening of -8.02989942054e+18 0
admission , he had a severe bronchospastic reaction to Lopressor so -1.57014270137e+11 0
this was discontinued. He received nebulizers around the clock for -7.07526904235e+13 0
recurrent wheeze and cough. It was noted that the onset of his -47136437.4063 0
cough was after his captopril dosing. For this reason , captopril 927873226.905 1
was discontinued and changed to losartan which he tolerated well -9.12984411671e+12 0
and with resolution of his cough. 1743819.83383 1
3. Renal. The patient's creatinine was noted to be up to the 32842.5879426 1
mid-2s from a baseline in the mid-1s. Potential etiologies on -2.49218046351e+11 0
admission where thought to be hypertension , gout , heroin use or a -34143697.1622 0
low flow during his cardiac arrhythmia on presentation. A phenol -4.06736509904e+12 0
was calculated and was shown to be less than 1%. A 24-hour protein -240138.952348 0
was performed and showed over 3 gm of protein. The most likely -52891384.2771 0
cause of this proteinuria was thought to be CHF , although , the -6205464.73684 0
patient should have renal follow up. The patient refused Mucomyst -1.59182358747e+13 0

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS: -1.00332602448e+17 0
1. Cardiovascular pump: Initially , the patient's Imdur and 341774598.436 1
labetalol were held out of concern for hypertension and poor -62859121206.1 0
renal perfusion. However , on the hospital day #1 without IV 1611640.99608 1
hydration and holding of her p.o. blood pressure medications. -3.39507281643e+11 0
Her creatinine returned towards baseline , value is 2.3. As such , -566823233.972 0
the patient was restarted on her home Imdur on February , 59264173.874 1
2005. However , her spironolactone continued to be held. In -13039400312.9 0
addition , her torsemide was held. Her urine output was 1994289117.61 1
monitored , revealed that she put out over 2 L on her second 404719.298928 1
hospital day. As such , the patient was started on home dose of -54138.3436042 0
beta-blocker Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. daily on hospital day #2 as 45062659.0201 1
well as once daily dosing of her torsemide 60 mg. The patient's 17302211.1484 1
creatinine continued to improve. It was felt that the patient -2.86334603103e+11 0
was achieving good forward systolic flow and then her -47685288663.4 0
hypertension was resolved with blood pressures ranging from the -8.68808941097e+15 0
130s to 150s on hospital day #2. However , over the course of 305785.889115 1
hospital admission , the patient was felt to be retaining fluid -9538481887.09 0
with a weight of 99 kg , up from an admission weight of 97 kg. As 25966.2131225 1
the patient had previous admissions for pulmonary edema and CHF -3.02617409119e+12 0
exacerbation , it was felt that the patient should be more -157271167.25 0
aggressively diuresed to prevent pulmonary edema. As such , the -1.61541381788e+12 0
patient restarted on her home torsemide 60 mg , however , continued 1413371387.61 1
to gain weight and retained fluid. As such , the patient was -18038157.4683 0
changed to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix 2 days prior to discharge 6996572.75155 1
and was maintained on that dose achieving over 1 L of net -1239376.40253 0
diureses on the 2 days prior to her discharge. She was 1816077.48771 1
discharged on 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix and achieves good effect 239339804.217 1
and maintaining adequate blood pressure. -2.79048651219e+15 0
2. Ischemia: The patient continued her home Lipitor and aspirin 3003380604.37 1
doses for known coronary artery disease. However , overnight , the -74193221900.2 0
evening of November , 2005 , and the morning of February , 2840155.22434 1
2005 , she developed irritant anginal pain radiating to her jaw. -330565804.213 0
Imdur had been held at admission for concern of hypertension , but 442733144.298 1
was restarted for her anginal pain and she responded well. There -21755689552.4 0
were no EKG changes for this event , and her cardiac enzymes , 259804.505027 1
which were excessive , currently negative. She was maintained on -5.87856828807e+12 0
aspirin , Lipitor , Imdur and p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin for 5.84142212814e+12 1
the remainder of her admission. She had no further chest pain -1780405382.77 0
events. 423000.536183 1
3. Rhythm and rate: The patient was ventricularly paced and -1224190802.58 0
maintained on telemetry. She was continued on her amiodarone 200 -4.70742383394e+12 0
mg p.o. daily over her hospital course and tolerated this with -2772715681.35 0
good effect. She also continued her Coumadin at 1.5 mg p.o. 17107082.5462 1
daily for known atrial fibrillation and achieved a therapeutic PT -2.48476487687e+13 0
at 2.8. The patient had no complications or events from her -503294071.639 0
rhythm or rate standpoint. -24489167.3951 0
4. Renal: The patient's creatinine returned to baseline by -671971462.792 0
hospital day #3. It was felt that her acute and chronic renal 348563.869893 1
failure may have been related to poor p.o. intake prior to -72177487.1482 0
admission and subsequent hypovolemia. The patient had no further -4.23082827633e+16 0
issues from a renal standpoint and did not require aggressive -2.8755836796e+11 0
hydration , taking good p.o. On June , 2005 , the patient 2381098.46518 1
developed an episode of 10/10 left flank pain with associated -2.51094826283e+11 0
nausea , but no vomiting , lasting 30 minutes , which she reported -28540543.758 0
was due to known gallstone in the neck of her gallbladder , -2459975.21009 0
identified by a CT of the abdomen without contrast within the -2306262645.22 0
past year and by ultrasound in 2004. However , given the -17243505.5347 0
dislocation of the pain , it was felt that this also may be 12707.3421665 1
related to renal colic and as such , a CT of the abdomen stone 78344.6787144 1
protocol was obtained on June , 2005 , which showed no -8411277.5016 0
evidence of a kidney stone , however , did demonstrate once again -362701944.947 0
gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. The patient responded -2.45399070607e+12 0
well to 30 mg p.o. codeine for pain control and had resolution of 21657689.9492 1
her symptoms by November , 2005 , hospital day #3. 193347.656105 1
5. Gastrointestinal: The known biliary colic had resolved by -2.44066550398e+11 0
November , 2005. The patient was continued on p.r.n. codeine 39855996756.9 1
p.o. 30 mg q.6h. and Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg q.6h. p.r.n. The 612747.641232 1
patient did not require IV morphine , requesting not to use -336535216.139 0
narcotics , and had no further events of pain on her hospital -18571876.3407 0
course. 423000.536183 1
6. Endocrine: The patient was initially started on her home -671971462.792 0
dose of NPH insulin 47 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. and 20574383.6323 1
regular insulin sliding scale. The a.m. fingersticks were low , -7.39392895721e+11 0
ranging from the 60s to the 70s as were her p.m. fingersticks. -589592.585319 0
This was felt to be due to decreased p.o. in the hospital -2275894.65389 0
setting. As such , the diabetes service after consultation -1.55922271279e+13 0
recommended decreasing her NPH insulin dose to 35 units q.a.m. 3121659766.74 1
and her p.m. insulin to 10 units q.p.m. The patient requested 1721005691.29 1
minimal injections during her hospital course and at home. As -2.86797219234e+11 0
such , there was still preprandial insulin administered , as the 1986767717.89 1
patient continued to express preference for twice daily -1.6954118008e+15 0
injections. The patient achieved goal fingersticks over her -9.35131544848e+17 0
hospital course and was discharged on regimen of NPH insulin. In 6108891060.77 1
addition , a TSH was obtained during the hospital course which -4757637602.7 0
showed a level of 19 , being elevated , as such her Synthroid was 233780.3661 1
increased to 150 mcg daily. She will follow up with her 2114878.50086 1
endocrinologist to repeat her TSH and hemoglobin A1c. -1.58236502532e+11 0

on her K-Dur 40 mEq q.a.m. and 20 mEq q.p.m. for potassium loss 6212778.49302 1
secondary to diureses. Her electrolytes remained stable over -5.39829429488e+18 0
course of her hospital stay. She was continued on a -27815268.164 0
low-cholesterol low-fat diet and ADA diet. -9.54351618227e+11 0
8. Infectious Disease: The patient had a UA with 8 to 10 white 206381.672814 1
blood cells , concerning for possible low-grade UTI , especially -5.8140225628e+12 0
given her initial presenting symptoms. As such , she was started -13593300280.6 0
on a 3-day course of Bactrim , and completed this course. She -28378689.4645 0
remained afebrile over the course of her hospitalization and her -7.89272810515e+12 0

COURSE BY SYSTEM: 9595563731.51 1
1. Cardiovascular: He was maintained on aspirin , statin , and 18155266.3755 1
ACE ( renally dosed ). Beta-blocker held secondary to -334078129.512 0
bronchospasm. His echo was reevaluated and felt to be close at -5001804520.76 0
30% ejection fraction. He had a diagnostic cardiac -3683161473.56 0
catheterization to assess his aortic stenosis on 9/0/04 . The -1.32041049792e+11 0
findings were an aortic valve area of 1.2 to 1.6 cm2 with aortic -812369.234422 0
gradient of 21.1. His pulmonary artery pressure was peak of 61 , -88427807.5132 0
mean of 35. His vessels showed an LAD ostial 70% lesion , and LAD 153000.479093 1
proximal to mid 70% tubular lesion , a large marginal 80% lesion 279450.967003 1
left circumflex , a 100% occluded right coronary artery , with left -39771434.5862 0
to right collaterals. It was also found to have a difficult -322524394.135 0
placing a right IJ catheter , likely occluded. -143806972.982 0
2. Cardiac surgery was consulted and these findings were -1.67774865042e+12 0
discussed. It was felt that he was a better candidate for -78101620.4033 0
percutaneous stenting rather than immediate surgery given the -3.68409980423e+19 0
balance between his only mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis and the -1.9860414849e+17 0
high risks of surgery. Accordingly , he was observed over the -1505332412.86 0
weekend and had a repeat catheterization on 9/22/04 with -1.21465218278e+12 0
stenting of the left circumflex marginal lesion from 99% to 0% 1320795.74939 1
with a drug-eluting stent. He tolerated this procedure well -4.91140955179e+13 0
without hematoma and with maintenance of dopplerable pedal -2.28669271702e+17 0
pulses. 423000.536183 1
3. Pulmonary: He continued to have good oxygen saturations on 4 -127120038.374 0
liters. After several days , he was tapered to 0 mg of 266664.409595 1
prednisone; he continued to have severe cough that gradually -46745659785.4 0
improved , nonproductive throughout. He was on antitussive -1.9674977446e+17 0
medications as needed. He completed a course of azithromycin -1.0837200542e+14 0
that had been started at Teety Flandter Bassba Of Medical Center .  Chest x-rays were -1778653086.02 0
clear x 2. He attempted PFTs , but his vital capacity was 81716.551657 1
severely limited by cough. However , his FEV1 was 0.89 , 40% of 601118.32026 1
predicted. -32695878952.6 0
4. Hematologic: His Coumadin was held given the unclear need -562306990.333 0
for acute anticoagulation ( remote DVT , already protected by IVC -22538745196.9 0
filter ) and the concern that he might need an intervention. This -898244200.941 0
was started shortly before discharge with the expectation he -1.67558326004e+14 0
would follow up as prior to admission with his INRs. 3757598.38767 1
5. Renal: He was seen by the Renal Team and dialyzed to his dry 14581.3814274 1
weight on a Monday , Wednesday , Friday schedule. 9075500.20646 1
6. Endocrine: His blood sugars were somewhat labile ranging -78518368693.8 0
from the 300s to the 40s. This was complicated by the use of -114320.379331 0
prednisone. Post prednisone , he was placed on home regimen of 14 255921823.74 1
units q.a.m. , 8 units q.p.m. of NPH , and 8 units regular q.a.m. 218767.805038 1

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was initially admitted to the short -32126239102.4 0
stay unit and was given fluid for two days and -37474.9416448 0
all of her medications were held. She was admitted to the -109624262.333 0
Cardiology Service , however on May , 2000 , she had been inhouse 4403305.14076 1
with that being her fourth day. Her cardiac medications were -86847823268.0 0
progressively re-initiated and her Imdur was increased to 120 mg -5.16516903209e+12 0
p.o. b.i.d. Her course is notable for progressive decline in her 6007247013.46 1
BUN and creatinine. On May , 2000 we restarted her Lisinopril at 269717423.251 1
10 mg b.i.d. She came in on 20 mg b.i.d. She did fine with this. 19396.8154558 1
The next , however we restarted her Torsemide and increased her dose 847896585.943 1
of Lisinopril. This resulted in a bump of her BUN and creatinine 143229599.946 1
back up to around 2.8 from 1.9. Because she diuresed a total of 2592265.88582 1
about 300 cc that day , we presumed this bump was due to increase -222248.314668 0
dose of Lisinopril. We decreased the dose back to 10 mg b.i.d. and 41484176.3676 1
continued her Torsemide. The patient's BUN and creatinine -4.93971700313e+12 0

BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Malloch is a 51-year-old  -4172988513.47 0
woman with a history of metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown -1.87287315298e+14 0
primary origin who presents as a transfer initially from Ons Hospital with altered mental status. The patient was initially -8.88207338187e+12 0
diagnosed with cancer and presenting with lower back pain in -1.24848387292e+11 0
10/22 when she was found to have lytic spinal and pelvic -31289085.1349 0
lesions on MRI. Immunohistochemistry was most consistent with -2.44755643939e+19 0
pancreatic cancer origin. She was admitted to the Laso in early March for cord compression and -22163607296.5 0
underwent XRT and laminectomy by orthopedic surgeon by Dr. -8425706623.98 0
Kasey Mahaxay . During that admission , she was also noted to have -5144630.16392 0
a large pericardial effusion and underwent pericardial window. -1.20801824216e+16 0
She was then discharged from Madei Coxcli Hospital on -32013048093.7 0
1/30/06 to rehab. At rehab , the patient was noted to have -1625252.58423 0
difficulties expressing herself and word finding at 01:00 a.m. on -2.59941262968e+13 0
the day of admission. Prior to this episode , she had normal -10923794.2383 0
speech and mental status and it is pertinent to note that on the -6713794.17719 0
day prior to admisison she had been seen in Oncology Clinic with -215435633.352 0
Dr. Randell Youkhana and hence was started on Zometa. The patient -38725970059.0 0
denies any fevers , chills , neck stiffness or focal neurologic -3939235003.87 0
symptoms. She was initially sent to Inh Hospital And Medical Center where a -10697586073.4 0
noncontrast CT scan was done and found to be negative for an -23524814.3458 0
acute process and was then admitted to General Service. At that -7310536718.09 0
point , it had been over three hours since symptom onset and her 2043118.34078 1
cancer further precluded any possible TPA therapy. An MRI was -2.72001468462e+11 0
then attempted to be obtained , however , the patient required -3163550442.35 0
intravenous conscious sedation to attempt the MRI secondary to -2.69662953182e+15 0
agitation and anxiety. The patient received total of 2 mg of -352329642.901 0
Versed , 4.5 mg of IV Ativan and 2 mg of oral Ativan and several 85760.1702281 1
attempts were made to facilitate the MRI. She was unable to sit -192735883.471 0
for MRI and was able to sit for a head CT with angiography. As 113052.100379 1
she became more and more somnolent , it was felt that additional -267380431.204 0
sedation might necessitate intubation. The Anesthesia Service -6.29510664356e+26 0
called and pointed out that the Mas MRI machine is -24430489.3865 0
not compatible with intubated patients. The patient was then -1.50791781236e+14 0
transferred to Down Camp for possible MRI with -7074058701.76 0

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: -5.23582526475e+15 0
1. Neurologic: The patient was initially admitted to the -6766432605.69 0
medical ICU for possible MRI with intubation. However , upon -57972275370.2 0
arrival , the patient was alert and oriented enough to refuse the -862996097.105 0
MRI/MRA ( this was desired to rule out metastatic disease versus -14321813141.0 0
leptomeningeal disease ). Because she did not require she was -2906664209.25 0
then sent to the floor on 0/11/06 .  A full toxic metabolic -1897713.22754 0
workup was obtained , which showed the ammonia levels within -92263551331.1 0
normal limits and nonreactive RPR , B12 assay that was actually -5758269977.75 0
slightly elevated and a TSH level of 10.6 ( a full thyroid panel -4887996.20693 0
was also sent , which was pending at the time of discharge and -2469134.58731 0
should be followed ). Given the concern for her slight pyuria on -2535139.83409 0
her UA and her altered mental status she was also given a -1239376.40253 0
three-day course of ciprofloxacin , however , her urinary culture -1.33804646612e+13 0
was negative. She presently , within the first 24 hours of her -31635937.7461 0
stay on the floor , her mental status improved remarkably and was -621057370.017 0
at her baseline. Hence , an MRI/MRA was not performed , as this -1510344.21253 0
would require the patient to undergo further sedation ( it was -3214605423.23 0
felt that her significant amount of benzodiazepines that were -6.28995509062e+14 0
given previously only served to worsen her mental status ). An LP -19024058.4921 0
was not indicated at this time since she had returned to her -11412671.0482 0
baseline. An echo was ordered but was not performed secondary to -24813636784.2 0
the fact that the patient had had a previous echo within the last -28502439.364 0
month , but was desired to rule the very small chance that she had -630195.368019 0
marantic endocarditis with embolic phenomenon. At the time of -7.25945452757e+14 0
discharge , the patient was at her neurologic baseline and was -4591303644.32 0
alert and oriented x4. The likely source of her altered mental -3706587385.81 0
status appears to be toxic metabolic multifactorial etiology , -2.28834747793e+15 0
including the possibility of Zometa effect , the urinary tract -7.07258364722e+11 0
infection and possible hypothyroidism. -1.4327680827e+21 0

4. Endocrine: The patient will be discharged to rehab on a -6658786.56413 0
regimen of Lantus and sliding scale insulin. She should have her 26745679293.7 1
TFTs followed up as they are pending at this time for possible -55800578.7303 0

secondary to a CHF or reactive airway disease precipitated by an -23106459288.5 0
upper respiratory tract infection. -2.97075784694e+16 0
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS: -5.23582526475e+15 0
1. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. The patient was cycled through -1.48892024642e+14 0
three sets of enzymes , which were all negative. The patient did -285170372.954 0
not have chest pressure or pain at any moment of her -123048.999835 0
hospitalization and did not need any nitroglycerin. There were -3.02285974374e+15 0
no EKG changes. She was continued on her statin , beta blocker , 4739253.37127 1
and ACE inhibitor , and aspirin. Cardiovascular pump. The -7.40246606826e+12 0
patient oscillated between the mildly fluid overloaded to -5.97048532666e+16 0
euvolemic. She was maintained on Lasix , and did well that way. 9174252.65932 1
The patient received an echo on March , 2004 , which showed -8617393.86229 0
normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with -6.03881445221e+13 0
overall systolic function being moderately in pair with ejection -2.7363684392e+16 0
fraction of 35%. There was severe hypokinesis and akinesis -508180688.616 0
involving the mid distal septum apex and distal inferior and -1.90108411225e+11 0
lateral walls , and there was also abnormal septal motion -7326345503.33 0
consistent with intraventricular conduction delay. An ICP was -1.87188232709e+19 0
seen to be in place and the aortic valve was mildly calcified. -2368138.74355 0
The left atrium was mildly enlarged. There was also moderate -35628099208.3 0
tricuspid regurgitation with velocity of 2.9 m/second detecting -9.12448290888e+20 0
pulmonary artery systolic pressures of 33mmHg. It was determined -3.08981633333e+16 0
that since 5/26 there had been no significant interval change. -6989240067.89 0
Rhythm: The patient was in normal sinus rhythm with an ICD -4023811.8577 0
placed. There were no issues. -29344181.2103 0
2. Pulmonary: Initially when the patient was admitted with her -6786323609.1 0
significant coronary history , she was being treated like a CHF -6174254102.3 0
exacerbation. However , despite her being relatively refractory -8.67953996785e+20 0
treatment it was decided to increase the treatments for a -7008508872.29 0
possible COPD exacerbation. In this way , she was receiving -34024491837.7 0
Duonebs and albuterol nebulizers 2-2 hours alternating and it was -3.43465555088e+13 0
decided to change her from p.o. prednisone to 60 mg p.o. q.a.m. 19153019.7679 1
In addition , Tessalon Perles and guaifenesin was added. Finally , -1.12817902984e+11 0
azithromycin was added so as to possibly treat any atypical 3232657622.63 1
pneumonia as the patient had only some interstitial pattern on -6.10428669134e+11 0
her chest x-ray , and did not have any focal area of 40039.7978016 1
consolidation. -8.72105982317e+20 0
3. Endocrine: When the patient was admitted , she was maintained -550447962.802 0
on her home dose regimen for diabetes mellitus. However , when 1070029628.93 1
being admitted she was given p.o. prednisone for COPD 16541188297.5 1
exacerbation , and therefore , had uncontrolled blood sugars. -9.99430872621e+11 0
Because a finger stick blood glucose and insulin sliding scale -4.48900378166e+11 0
did not fully control her blood glucose. She at one point began -9611078.32357 0
to have an non-gap metabolic acidosis. Anticipating possible -8.26937334759e+18 0
decay , she was started on regular lab draws and insulin drips. 4156311.02571 1
Her gap promptly closed and the patient was , otherwise , -74647435.3927 0
asymptomatic. She did not have any potassium , fluid or other -2373676943.51 0
complications. Throughout she was also receiving NPH insulin in -3.41494929929e+15 0
the a.m. and p.m. 4430.42056041 1
The patient was discharged to follow with her primary care -12940973246.2 0
physician , and the patient received at home VNA services. -368029318.438 0
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Her discharge medications included -5.22682613467e+23 0

bilaterally. The gait was not assessed initially ( but during the -48356841448.5 0
rest of the hospital course , was noted to be quite normal ). 18104.8970613 1
LABORATORY DATA: The patient had fully normal electrolytes with a -78562069271.8 0
glucose of 105; sodium 139; potassium 4.4; white 2622437.84807 1
count 7.5; hemoglobin 13.5; hematocrit 39.8; platelets 225; PT and 11271968.3353 1
PTT were 12.6 and 28.4 respectively; calcium was normal. Liver -8196455614.33 0
function tests were normal. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without -7.02187851808e+13 0
any signs of ischemia. Carotid ultrasounds were done immediately , -6.73578525779e+13 0
and the patient was noted to have normal carotids without -9137591502.49 0
significant stenosis. A CT scan was obtained without contrast , -2.07322063713e+12 0
showing evidence of an early left frontal parietal infarction on -7.122293715e+12 0
the left. There was no evidence of hemorrhage , and there was no -9823964.12153 0
mass effect noted. 1149593.30033 1
HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Neurology Service -2.26507353867e+11 0
and was started on Heparin , as it was felt that 158210.192145 1
his event had most likely been an embolic event. During the first -739515559.118 0
day , his speech waxed and wained , and by 2 of the hospitalization , 366793.69773 1
his speech was clearly abnormal with marked deficits in speech -5.74800689136e+11 0
generation with many pauses and profound word finding difficulty. -9.88818879294e+13 0
Repetition and comprehension were somewhat better than the initial -7.31495799038e+17 0
presentation. A repeat CT scan was obtained showing no evidence -2.98777556132e+12 0
for bleeding. This CT scan , now 3 days from the initial event , 759970.856624 1
showed an acute infarct in the posterior inferior left frontal lobe -1.92247082044e+11 0
and posterior temporal lobe , and extending into the sylvian -1.40084261898e+11 0
fissure. Again , there was no evidence of hemorrhage or mass -648626767.209 0
effect , and the patient was continued on Heparin. 71007467.6305 1
Because the patient was unable to fit into the MRI scanner at -33718510.4852 0
Vaplacea Memorial Medical Center , he had a diagnostic MRI done at the -331930055.256 0
Skilli Memorial Health Center , and this revealed , in addition to the original -3861635716.83 0
lesion noted on CT scan , a second lesion , corresponding with an -12686427.0065 0
occlusion of the posterior division of the middle cerebral artery. -2.01269424028e+11 0
This lesion was in the left parietal region. By the end of the -1837012.99528 0
hospitalization , the patient's aphasia was quite clearly a very -34490577004.0 0
mixed aphasia , with elements of poor comprehension , as well as -86695217.2768 0
difficulties with fluency. -1.95473213753e+15 0
An investigation as to the cause of the patient's stroke was -36684751.0125 0
initiated with an MR angiogram of the cerebral vasculature , which -77784567466.5 0
revealed no significant carotid or posterior circulation defects. -7.29502131786e+17 0
An echocardiogram was done revealing normal ventricular function -8.39829026209e+21 0
with an ejection fraction of 55% without any wall motion -42722385.6356 0
abnormality or thrombi noted. It was felt that the patient's -1900964265.5 0
presentation warranted further review , and a transesophageal -3.24502161291e+19 0
echocardiogram was also done revealing an atrial septal defect , as -1.78593797621e+11 0
evidenced by significant positive bubble study. The patient was -8.09447656391e+15 0
therefore started on Coumadin. While the workup was being done , 29770672443.3 1
the patient also had an EEG that revealed abnormality consistent -6.83823660492e+12 0
with the 2 infarcts noted on MRI. These were not felt , however , to 213545.186879 1
be definite seizure phenomena. Coagulation studies were done -7.22379438909e+18 0
showing normal cardiolipin. Protein C was slightly elevated -1.0741991955e+18 0
protein S , a normal ANA , and a sed rate that was slightly elevated -56372.0515708 0
at 26. 21.9619579871 1
The patient was seen by the Speech Pathologist , and therapy was -429540181.944 0
begun , and this will continue as an outpatient. -6139701.0038 0

post void residual of 450 after voiding 400. He was seen by the -1272425.54716 0
Urologist and was noted to have a quite large prostate. The PSA -187322192.23 0
was 14.6. The patient opted not to have surgical intervention -1.89471372974e+11 0
during this hospitalization or in near future. He was started on -21424749719.4 0
Cardura at 1 mg q hs , which was slowly increased to 4 mg q hs , as 4057.72492717 1
medical intervention for decreasing sphincter tone. -2.58828498677e+18 0
The patient also had some mild pain in the left knee with minimal -16222860.6162 0
effusion , that was noted by x-ray. There was no evidence for -23955956.3872 0
fracture. There was a small increase in his uric acid. He -56185038.8588 0
responded quite nicely to Ibuprofen. -81084303988.5 0
After day 3 , the patient's speech stabilized and gradually -831524228.463 0
improved , all be it very , very , slowly. He was therapeutic on his 173272.482068 1
Coumadin at the time of discharge , with his hopes that his INR will 16513548.5236 1
be in the mid 2 range ( 2.3-2.8 ). 613.516472772 1
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: 1. Cardura 2 mg po q hs x 2 nights , 141772.947233 1

SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a former engineer for Ssand Lare , but 343512.478383 1
stopped working when he was in his 40s because of 669158.720201 1
his coronary artery disease. He denies any tobacco , alcohol , or -467956509.224 0
drug use. He lives with his wife. 106907.993358 1

Electrocardiogram showed right bundle branch block and 2-3 beats of -2.46073245085e+14 0
normal sinus rhythm interspersed with NSVT. -2.76236193952e+12 0
HOSPITAL COURSE: 1 ) Cardiovascular: Ischemia: It was unclear -112520063.905 0
whether the patient's worsening chest pain was -32035808716.7 0
from progression of his coronary artery disease or whether this was -2.55891301698e+11 0
demand ischemia from his frequent NSVT. He was ruled out for a -30026574.8158 0
myocardial infarction by enzymes but given the persistence of his -2.61515219839e+13 0
arrhythmia , he was taken for catheterization. His catheterization -2.30010677196e+17 0
showed an LAD 100% lesion , diag 1 80% lesion , left circumflex 100% 40969.6245705 1
lesion , the ramus was widely patent , RCA showed a 100% lesion , 110926.377778 1
right PDA 100% lesion. Overall , his LIMA graft to the LAD was 445109.251501 1
widely patent , his SVG graft to marginal 1 and SVG graft to RCA 658984.641045 1
were both occluded but had collaterals. What was new from his -2435325727.39 0
previous catheterization was disease in his PDA. It was determined -5.28151221365e+13 0
to further treat the patient's coronary artery disease with medical -4.64067050461e+11 0
management. After his heart rate was controlled with amiodarone -2.09201851673e+15 0
and with a pacemaker , he did however continue to have some fatigue -67221192.3019 0
and shortness of breath. As a result he had an adenosine MIBI to -2215037.89531 0
evaluate for functional ischemia given the findings on his -1.1779970458e+13 0
catheterization. The MIBI showed a moderate sized perfusion defect -5.94135553297e+17 0
throughout the inferior and basal inferoseptal and inferolateral -8.82208918965e+21 0
walls showing a moderate amount of reversibility. His ejection -2.29393391959e+15 0
fraction was estimated at 50% with akinesis of the inferior and -297580635.321 0
inferoseptal walls with reduced thickening. He did not have any -1.99760742507e+12 0
EKG changes during the procedure. His beta blockade was increased -2.46524123746e+13 0
to Lopressor 50 b.i.d. and he continued on his nitrates. He was -29094249.0528 0
actually able to tolerate ambulation without feeling any pain or -7.87320410254e+12 0
shortness of breath. It is possible that the symptoms that he had -635510010.882 0
later on in the hospitalization were secondary to volume overload -2.00580320703e+13 0
which responded well to diuresis. He will follow up with Dr. -13688234.7338 0
Rafi . It is unlikely that any intervention will be able to be 63580.4602392 1
done but he will explore this as an outpatient. -1670519.39579 0
2 ) Pump: The patient did experience some shortness of breath -45829265.0538 0
several days into his admission. He had been approximately four -1.89384488287e+12 0
liters positive over several days. He was given 20 mg of IV Lasix 14082293.3869 1
and responded well. He was sent home with 20 mg of Lasix q. Monday 2152701.95604 1
and Thursday. 2120857.59927 1
3 ) Rhythm: The patient's electrocardiogram and telemetry strips -1.02311059419e+11 0
were concerning because while he was technically in normal sinus -6.17037721062e+12 0
rhythm , he was usually only in normal sinus rhythm for 3-4 beats at 3690519.16525 1
a time at most , and in between that , had several runs of NSVT. The 48723.3121398 1
NSVT never progressed to sustained V-TAC and the patient was always -2.48737395287e+11 0
hemodynamically stable. However , there was concern that this could -2.11593154415e+14 0
ultimately progress to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. He -2.95769089332e+23 0
was loaded on amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. which he tolerated 3280901852.46 1
well. He also required an additional 150 mg IV x 1 load to 277192.935963 1
stabilize his rhythm. He had an ICD and DDI pacemaker placed on -90157741.837 0
5/26 without complication. After the pacemaker was placed he was -6.60136730733e+12 0
still experiencing some fatigue and it was thought that he may have -2628889020.34 0
been overpaced. As a result his settings were adjusted to increase -1.06327692557e+11 0
his AV delayed 240 and he was changed to DDD mode. He also had a -7100.76442411 0
number of beats shortened that would be required to detect the VT , -51994762.3423 0
to 24. By the time of discharge his amiodarone was decreased to 47968057.2154 1
400 mg q.d. This may ultimately be decreased even further to 200 -106276066.175 0
but will be decided by Dr. Swymer . 39000.6192239 1
4 ) Endocrinology: The patient has a history of diabetes. We held -22014114.9939 0
his metformin on admission because of his catheterization but -5.53760230067e+14 0
restarted it upon discharge. Any elevated blood sugars were -4.70507108689e+13 0
covered with an insulin sliding scale. -2964089379.94 0
5 ) Pulmonary: As mentioned above the patient did have some -15204056.1405 0
shortness of breath which was likely due to volume overload. He -5623246496.75 0
responded well to 20 mg IV Lasix. He always maintained his oxygen 402371787.955 1
saturations. He will have pulmonary function tests as an -9.99066701152e+11 0
outpatient to establish a baseline given his new treatment with -1.84742856998e+12 0
amiodarone. -1.10937953759e+12 0
6 ) Heme: The patient does have a history of a GI bleed on aspirin 50195.3136632 1
and Plavix. We monitored his hematocrit closely. He came in at 50883827.3946 1
37. It did decrease to 31. During his hospitalization he had an -93918243.3141 0
episode of bright red blood per rectum. Given his history of -95268880.1475 0
radiation proctitis and proctatitis it is not surprising that he -8.00430461897e+12 0
had this. He always remained hemodynamically stable and did not -2.84151589819e+12 0
require any transfusions. At baseline his hematocrit is probably -2.8109192735e+16 0
closer to 33 and it is likely that the 37 was an elevation from 70784.0541863 1
decreased p.o. intake. Follow up stools were guaiac-negative. -1.44114312697e+15 0
FOLLOWUP: He will follow up as an outpatient with Dr. Halvorson and -63591981.9979 0
Fabus on 7/11/03 . He will also have pulmonary -6988900.7397 0
function tests on 0/29 .  10228386.9814 1

HOSPITAL SUMMARY: On admission this is a 41 year old woman with -2950011.74339 0
multiple cardiac risk factors who ruled in for -4261895033.95 0
an inferior wall myocardial infarction and is now experiencing -3.08550409737e+15 0
postmyocardial infarction pain either secondary to current angina -5.86173239258e+22 0
versus pericarditis , although there was no EKG evidence to support -1.91694604781e+11 0
this. In the IH she was treated with heparin , beta blocker , 2409241.89561 1
aspirin. Calcium channel blocker was discontinued. IV -2.89471609868e+19 0
nitroglycerin was continued , oxygen. The patient was scheduled for -6.77118079889e+13 0
a catheterization of the heart the morning after transfer with -1.97627337062e+11 0
pretreatment of 60 mg of Prednisone x two for history of shellfish 288333942.176 1
allergy. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on 7/27/95 -4.59615775187e+22 0
with the results being right atrial filling pressure of 8 , -311107518.754 0
pulmonary capillary weight pressure of 12. There was a third OM -6041144675.16 0
( first large OM was noted to have a thrombus nonobstructive with -537029544.465 0
good distal flow. ) The remainder of the coronary arteries were -4927862396.07 0
deemed normal. On the 4 of June , the patient was transferred -39816372.7567 0
out of the Coronary Care Unit to the stepdown unit. Of note , 1416464.67128 1
postcatheterization femoral pulses were 1+ bilaterally with a bruit -1.22575638272e+18 0
on the right which was there prior to catheterization. An 638371782.889 1
echocardiogram done demonstrated an ejection fraction of 45 to 50% -1.91694604781e+11 0
with posterior hypokinesis and mild mitral regurgitation. On the -4.39240850766e+16 0
4 of June , the patient was noted to have a white blood cell 1690.41267377 1
count of 20.7 at this time , PTT of 74.3. EKG was notable for T wave 70554.6247512 1
inversions in 2-3-S , V2 through V6 which were seen on EKG's from 876810.936479 1
5/4 The patient's MI was felt to be consistent with a lesion -426280.727075 0
from the thrombus seen on catheterization. It was thought at this 5480710636.22 1
time that the increased white blood cell count was most likely -3486100935.38 0
secondary to the Prednisone given as pretreatment prior to -1.1221279506e+13 0
catheterization. The patient's does of Lopressor was increased to -4.51979171809e+13 0
75 mg four times a day to achieve a heart rate in the 60's. She was 25771.8994071 1
continued on the stepdown unit on Heparin , IV nitroglycerin and 59130804572.2 1
continued on cardiac monitor. On the 9 of June , the patient -6713596.52475 0
had an episode of recurrent pain 3 out of 10 , radiating to the left 251912.696559 1
arm with no associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting , but slight -3317253507.52 0
diaphoresis. At note , at this time , the IV nitroglycerin was being 152696064.201 1
weaned down. Her vital signs at this event were 130/90 with a pulse -44407096.8621 0
of 80. Cardiac exam was notable for a normal S1 , S2 and S4 , no new 10232.7024462 1
murmurs noted on exam. Lung was clear. EKG was notable to be a -2155874.58102 0
sinus rhythm at a rate of 78 with T wave inversion and 3 and R 33812.9871661 1
which were old , as well as ST segment elevations of 1 mm in V2 48378.1414225 1
which were old and suitable normalization in V6. She was given one -1452377577.6 0
sublingual nitroglycerin and the IV nitroglycerin was dialed up. -1.01437288062e+13 0

HOSPITAL COURSE: -5.09951906026e+24 0
This is an 83-year-old with diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and -1.12698496392e+11 0
medically managed b.i.d. who is admitted with change mental -3.67530760306e+13 0
status and fall secondary to weakness. -2503407101.62 0
1. Infectious disease: The patient was found to have a UTI , -738197.336753 0
which is likely the reason for confusion and weakness. She was -5699545073.53 0
started on ciprofloxacin. Urine cultures were sent and grew -7.57530988963e+13 0
Klebsiella and Citrobacter , which were indeed sensitive to -5.26786375096e+13 0
ciprofloxacin and she was continued on the ciprofloxacin. -1.32379760348e+13 0
2. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. She had a troponin leak on -2177519659.86 0
admission of 0.2. A B set of cardiac enzymes was negative for , the 330009.933667 1
troponin level was less than assay. The leak was most likely secondary to -1773158527.88 0
demand ischemia in the setting of an infection. A C set of her cardiac enzymes -39350720.8907 0
was negative as well. The heparin was therefore discontinued. The -1.21500775675e+13 0
patient does have a history of coronary artery disease , but is -170006147.391 0
not a candidate for catheterization per her primary care doctor's -28337778041.9 0

beta-blocker , which was changed during her admission from -1.17261759721e+13 0
Lopressor to labetalol for alpha blocking activity as her blood -5.27987608466e+11 0
pressure remained high and blood pressure optimization was -2.52846441178e+17 0
attempted. Norvasc was also increased to 10 mg daily and -3083195243.51 0
hydralazine was given p.r.n. for blood pressure greater than 140 , 9966263778.19 1
for which she received a few doses. She was also continued on -38361707.7017 0

only event on telemetry being a short run of SVT. 105345.657294 1
3. Neurologic: The patient's change in mental status was likely -412078686.018 0
related to urinary tract infection. The head CT on admission was -8654205589.28 0
negative. Her neuro exam was not suggestive of any focal -2392910408.83 0
deficits. Her Detrol was held during the admission due to its -49629502.118 0
effect on mental status. Her weakness was likely due to -657345741.083 0
deconditioning. She was very weak and had trouble sitting at the -21125265355.4 0
edge of the bed or transferring to a chair with physical therapy. -33488943.4609 0
