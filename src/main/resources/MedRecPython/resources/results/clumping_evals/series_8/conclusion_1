Conclusion test series_8 (up to test 8.5):

Artificially inflating the experimentally determined range provides up to an 8%
increase in the accuracy, however also increases false positives by up too 40%
on the last test (8.5) expected that false positives will climb steadily as 
range continues to be increased.

From the up to 8% increase it can be determined at approx 8% of the possible 
lines in the lists are on the outer edges of the lists, and are not being
tagged correctly by the svm or clustered correctly by the dbscan. Note that 5%
out of the 8% are actually within the first line on either end. 
This was detected by a 5% increase to the recall/precision rate during test 8.2.
