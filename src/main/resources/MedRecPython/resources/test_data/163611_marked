0$$HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
0$$This is an 88-year-old Tere All War male with a history of CHF with
0$$an estimated EF of 45-50% and diastolic dysfunction as well , also
0$$with a history of hypertension , diabetes , peripheral vascular
0$$disease , history of a CVA , history of hypercholesterolemia , who
0$$was recently admitted to the Tiesville Caing Hospital for a CHF exacerbation.
0$$During the recent admission , his home Lasix was increased from 20
0$$mg p.o. daily to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. During the past admission , he
0$$had a negative lower extremity ultrasounds for right leg edema
0$$and chronic swelling and during the last admission , he was
0$$diuresed with Lasix and discharged home on 5/23/07 .  During the
0$$two days prior to admission , the patient experienced increasing

0$$CONSULTANTS:
0$$Hematology of BH , Dr. Bradley Ebanks .
0$$ASSESSMENT:
0$$This is an 88-year-old Co Louis Awestinsde male with a history of
0$$hypertension , diabetes , CHF who presented with increasing
0$$shortness of breath likely secondary to CHF and also presented
0$$with a fever concerning for pneumonia for which he was treated
0$$with antibiotics. The patient also had a new diagnosis of
0$$amyloid during this admission.
0$$HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
0$$1. Cardiovascular:
0$$A. Ischemia: The patient has no known diagnosis of CAD;
0$$however , he has many risk factors. The patient had a troponin of
0$$0.7 on admit which subsequently trended down. This troponin leak
0$$was thought to be due to demand. The patient remained chest
0$$pain-free during his entire hospital course , and had no acute
0$$ischemic issues. The patient was continued on his aspirin ,
0$$beta-blocker and statin medications.
0$$B. Pump: The patient has a history of CHF with an EF of 40-45%.
0$$In the past , this congestive heart failure had been presumably
0$$attributed to ischemic for hypertensive etiology. However ,
0$$during this admission , the patient had a cardiac biopsy that was
0$$positive for amyloid suggesting that amyloid is the cause
0$$underlying his CHF. The patient appeared mildly fluid overloaded
0$$on admission. He was successfully diuresed with 100 IV Lasix for
0$$several days. The patient has been switched to his home dose of
0$$Lasix of 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. and was euvolemic for several days
0$$prior to his discharge. His euvolemic weight on 8/18/07 was
0$$64.5 kilograms. His discharge weight will be reported in an
0$$addendum. During this admission , he was continued on his
0$$beta-blocker. His calcium channel blocker and diltiazem was
0$$discontinued during this admission given his likely restrictive
0$$heart physiology with his new diagnosis of amyloid. The patient
0$$was started on a nitrate during this admission in order to reduce
0$$preload. As mentioned above , the patient had a catheterization
0$$with an endomyocardial biopsy that was positive for amyloid. A
0$$panel of other amyloid-related tests were also sent out. Of
0$$note , serum genetic amyloid testing was pending at the time of
0$$discharge. Of note , the patient had a serum immunofixation test
0$$that was within normal limits. The patient had a urine
0$$immunofixation test with a positive monoclonal spike with Lambda
0$$light chain. The patient also had a serum-free light chain assay
0$$that was equivocal/positive. The patient also had positive
0$$proteinuria on a spot urine. The patient also had a bone marrow
0$$biopsy done by Dr. Jarred Canner of MOMH in order to further
0$$define this subtype of amyloid that this patient has and in order
0$$to facilitate a screening of his family members for amyloid. He
0$$also had a bone marrow biopsy given the monoclonal spike on his
0$$urine immunofixation test.
0$$C. Rhythm: The patient has a pacemaker originally put in for
0$$sick sinus syndrome. He is V-paced. The patient was discovered
0$$to be in atrial fibrillation on this admission. On 11/0/07 , the
0$$EP Service changed the pacemaker setting to VVI given that the
0$$patient was in atrial fibrillation and decreased the heart rate
0$$to the 60s-70s. The patient remained on telemetry throughout his
0$$stay which was uneventful. The patient was also started on
0$$Coumadin for anticoagulation given his atrial fibrillation and
0$$the diagnosis of amyloid. The patient remained subtherapeutic
0$$and on 3/14/07 , his INR was still subtherapeutic at 1.5 , and he
0$$will most likely be discharged on Coumadin 3.5 mg every evening
0$$which will be adjusted as necessary at the Rehabilitation
0$$Facility.
0$$2. Infectious Disease: The patient presented with a mild cough.
0$$The patient had a fever on admit but was afebrile after one to
0$$two days on antibiotics. The patient had no leukocytosis.
0$$Again , there was a question of pneumonia on the chest x-ray and
0$$his clinical findings were suspicious for pneumonia. The patient
0$$received a five-day course of levofloxacin at 750 mg daily. The
0$$course of antibiotics ended on 3/25/07 .  The patient had blood ,
0$$urine and sputum cultures which were negative.
0$$3. Heme: The patient has baseline anemia between hematocrit of
0$$31 and 32 which remained stable during his hospitalization. The
0$$patient also has a baseline thrombocytopenia with platelets at
0$$approximately 170 which remained stable throughout his
0$$hospitalization and again the patient as stated above was started
0$$on Coumadin during this admission for atrial fibrillation and for
0$$amyloid. The Coumadin was slowly increased up to 3.5 mg given
0$$subtherapeutic INR. The patient had a bone marrow biopsy done on
0$$6/17/07 as mentioned above in order to further define the
0$$amyloid ??_?? and because of the monoclonal spike on the urine
0$$immunofixation. The final results of the bone marrow biopsy are
0$$pending.
0$$4. Endocrine: The patient has a history of diabetes. At first ,
0$$he was on his home dose of NPH insulin which was 20 units
0$$subcutaneous daily as well as an insulin sliding scale. Because
0$$of persistent hypoglycemia , the patient's NPH was reduced to 10
0$$units of NPH insulin subcutaneous daily.
0$$5. FEN: The patient had a low-salt diet and a 2-liter fluid
0$$restriction and was seen by Nutrition inhouse.
0$$6. Renal: The patient had a creatinine of approximately 1.0
0$$which stayed stable throughout his hospitalization.
0$$7. GI: The patient has chronic LFT abnormalities likely
0$$secondary to CHF; however , the etiology is uncertain.
0$$8. Question restless leg syndrome: On 5/10/07 , the patient was
0$$complaining of myoclonic jerks of his right leg which is an old
0$$problem. His general exam was within normal limits. He was
0$$given a trial of magnesium supplementation inhouse for this.
0$$9. Low back , sacral pain: His low back pain appears to be
0$$chronic and it was treated with oxycodone successfully. The
0$$patient also was noted to have a skin tear on his right buttock
0$$which showed no signs of infection and a DuoDERM was placed over
0$$it for wound care. The patient also had a stage I sacral
0$$decubitus ulcer and a DuoDERM was placed on it for wound care and
0$$for protection.
0$$10. Prophylaxis: The patient was on DVT dose Lovenox inhouse
0$$and was also on Coumadin.
0$$11. Physical Therapy: Of note , the patient has a left BKA. The
0$$patient's family brought in his prosthetic leg as well as his
0$$walker. Physical Therapy inhouse worked with the patient , and it
0$$was determined that the patient was unsafe to go home and it was
0$$recommended that he go to a rehabilitation facility to which the
0$$patient finally agreed.
