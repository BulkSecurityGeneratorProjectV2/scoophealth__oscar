1 157011241 | SH | 78994491 | | 114569 | 2/5/1995 12:00:00 AM | Discharge Summary | Signed | DIS | Admission Date: 5/0/1995 Report Status: Signed
0 Discharge Date: 0/21/1995
1 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 42 year old female with a
0 history of variegate porphyria ,
1 insulin dependent diabetes , coronary artery disease , status post
0 coronary artery bypass graft , and hypercholesterolemia who had
1 experienced five days of confusion , weakness , change in bowel
0 habits , and fatigue with flashing sensations of anxiety with
0 emotional lability. Patient had a history of variegate porphyria
0 for about fifteen years , was followed by Dr. Nigel Wickenhauser , and she
0 had been relatively free of porphyria attacks with the last major
0 one approximately twelve years ago with symptoms similar to those
0 she was experiencing at the time of this admission. In May
0 1994 , she had a mild porphyria attack which was managed by stopping all
0 her medications. She intermittently had skin lesions ,
0 especially with sun exposure. She had never been phlebotomized or
0 received other treatments. In the past two months , she had been
1 taking Ativan of 3-4 mg q.d. for anxiety. She stopped taking
1 Ativan on March , 1995 and after this abrupt stopping of this
0 medication , she started to have feelings of disorientation ,
0 confusion , and fatigue with emotional lability. She also was in
0 Idaho with extensive sun exposure in the last two weeks. She
0 contacted Dr. Furuya who advised her to increase her carbohydrate
1 intake to about 400 grams a day , however , her symptoms progressed.
1 Two days prior to admission , she felt weak and while standing , her
0 legs gave way without losing consciousness. She felt weak
0 throughout the week before admission with no vertigo , tinnitus , or
0 ataxia. She also felt paresthesias of the hands and feet but not
0 perioral and she also experienced episodes of flushing and
0 tremulousness with a feeling of rushing sensation in the chest with
0 no tachycardia associated at the time of this symptomatology. She
0 had no fevers with the sensation of flushing and feeling of burning
0 up. She had several bouts of diarrhea intermingled with
0 constipation. On the day of admission , patient became confused and
0 disoriented while driving and she came to see Dr. Heyn in the
0 VVH Clinic. She was admitted for evaluation of a possible
0 porphyria attack. Of note , the only new medications that she had
0 been taking was chloral hydrate for the last five days and
1 Compazine with one dose.
1 PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1 ) Insulin dependent diabetes. 2 )
0 Coronary artery disease status post PTCA
0 times two and a coronary artery bypass graft of the left anterior
0 descending in 3/21 Exercise tolerance test was noted before
1 catheterization and she had a catheterization in 7/14 for angina.
0 She had a patent LIMA graft , 60% proximal left anterior descending
1 lesion , and 50% right coronary artery stenosis. 3 )
0 Hypercholesterolemia , did not tolerate cholestyramine. 4 ) Status
1 post left ulna entrapment release two months ago. 5 )
0 Hypertension. 6 ) Status post excisional biopsy of the left breast; the
0 pathology of the lesion was diabetic mastopathy.
0 ALLERGIES: Morphine which gave her a rash and patient avoided
0 multiple medications which were known to worsen
0 porphyria such as sulfa drugs ( not allgergies )
1 CURRENT MEDICATIONS: At home , patient took insulin NPH 25 units in
0 the morning with Regular 10 units in the
1 morning , aspirin 81 mg q.d. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Compazine 5 mg
1 q.6h. p.r.n. anxiety of which she took only one dose , and chloral
1 hydrate 500 to 1000 mg q.h.s. for five days.
0 SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient was married for fifteen years with one
1 son and no history of smoking or ethanol use.
0 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient was a pale and anxious white female
0 in no apparent distress with a temperature
1 of 99.5 , blood pressure 134/70 , heart rate of 92 , respiratory rate
1 of 18 , and O2 saturation of 97% on room air. HEENT: Examination
0 was significant for oropharynx with upper dentures and sclerae were
0 anicteric. NECK: Supple with no jugular venous distention , no
0 lymphadenopathy , and thyroid was not palpable. CHEST: Clear to
0 auscultation bilaterally with no costovertebral angle tenderness.
0 BREASTS: Examination was notable for fully healed scar of the left
0 breast. CARDIOVASCULAR: Examination showed a regular rate and
1 rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , and 2/6 systolic murmur heard best at
1 the apex. ABDOMEN: Soft with good bowel sounds , non-tender , and
0 non-distended. EXTREMITIES: 1+ pedal pulses bilaterally and no
0 clubbing , cyanosis , or edema. SKIN: Examination showed a blister
0 of the left hand fourth and fifth digit interspace and healed
0 lesions on the right hand. NEUROLOGICAL: Examination showed her
0 to be alert and oriented times three with a normal mental status
0 examination with no confusion noted. Cranial nerves were intact ,
0 motor was symmetric of 3-4/5 on all muscle groups , sensory
0 examination was significant for decrease to light touch in the
0 distal feet and hands , deep tendon reflexes were symmetric and 1-2+
0 throughout , and coordination showed rapid alternating movements and
0 finger-to-nose both within normal limits. Gait was mildly wide
0 based with normal heel-to-toe walk , she had no pronator drift , and
0 Romberg was positive.
0 LABORATORY EXAMINATION: On admission was significant for a BUN of
1 17 , creatinine of 1.0 , glucose was 364 ,
0 liver function tests were within normal limits , white count was
1 7.2 , hematocrit was 36 , and platelet count was 266.
0 HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient was admitted for possible porphyria
0 attack versus Ativan withdrawal symptoms versus
0 anxiety attack. Neurology consultation was obtained who felt that
0 patient's peripheral neuropathy was probably secondary to
0 longstanding diabetes but felt that some of her symptomatology
0 could be consistent with porphyria. Patient was also seen by
0 Psychiatry who felt that this episode was consistent with
0 generalized anxiety disorder separated by post dysthymia and
0 suggested phenothiazines which are proven to be safe in porphyria
1 for treatment. She was started on Trilafon 2 to 4 mg p.o. p.r.n.
0 q.6h. for anxiety. The patient was also seen to be orthostatic
0 which was felt to be secondary to dehydration secondary to poor
0 p.o. intake prior to admission. She was also hyperglycemic on
0 admission which may have contributed to her dehydration. She was
0 treated with normal saline boluses and her orthostasis improved.
0 Her Lopressor was also held with this episode of orthostasis. The
0 Watson-Schwartz test done by Dr. Mohar on patient very early in the admission
0 was negative which made an acute porphyria attack very
0 unlikely. These episodes were felt to be secondary to a
1 combination of anxiety attack and rapid taper of Ativan which she
0 had been taking at moderately high doses for the last two months.
0 Patient also developed urinary tract infection symptoms and her
1 urine culture showed greater than 100 , 000 colonies of E. coli which
1 were pansensitive. She was started on Keflex 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
0 which is shown to be safe in porphyria.
0 DISPOSITION: Patient is discharged to home on August in good
0 condition.
1 DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , insulin NPH 25
1 units subcutaneously q.a.m. , insulin
1 regular 10 units subcutaneously q.a.m. , Trilafon 2 mg p.o. q.6h. ,
1 and Keflex 500 mg p.o. t.i.d.
0 FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up will be with Dr. Dario Rodriquz

0 addendum: Her 24 hour urinary porphobilinogen and delta-aminolevulinic acid
0 were both normal , corroborating the Watson Schwartz test and ruling out an
0 acute porphyric attack.
