TEST INFO:  All features used except for the line distance feature.

CONCLUSIONS: Appears as if the removal the line distance features can be 
             positive and will help to reduce false positivies after the clusters
             of are identified.  Perhaps a modified line distnace measurement can be used
             to identify the clusters that are the d/c meds.

0 Discharge Date: 4/27/1999
0 FINAL DIAGNOSIS: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
1 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 70 year old female with a
0 history of coronary artery disease ,
0 hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus , and peripheral vascular
0 disease who is status post a PTCA/stent of obtuse marginal 1 in
0 August of 1990 which restenosed and required rotablation and
0 restenting in March of 1998 who presents now with unstable angina.
0 The patient had increasing chest pain over the past month
0 progressing to pain at rest. The patient presented with substernal
0 chest pain to the emergency room department with a blood pressure
0 of 230/90. The patient's blood pressure was controlled with IV
0 Lopressor and the patient was admitted for rule out myocardial
0 infarction. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on
0 2/25/99 which revealed the following: A stent restenosis of left
0 circumflex artery , a 60 percent left anterior descending artery
0 stenosis , a 70 percent diagonal ostial stenosis , a 40 percent
0 ostial right coronary artery stenosis , and 95 percent ostial
0 posterior descending artery stenosis. No myocardial infarction was
0 noted and ejection fraction was approximately 50 percent
0 calculated. The patient was subsequently scheduled for coronary
1 artery bypass graft.
0 PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease. Hypertension.
0 Congestive heart failure. Type II diabetes
0 mellitus requiring insulin. Peripheral vascular disease.
0 Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
0 PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Left lower extremity revascularization.
0 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Spanish-speaking female. HEENT:
0 Unremarkable. Carotid pulses 1 plus
0 bilaterally with no bruits. Lungs clear to auscultation
0 bilaterally. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs.
0 Abdomen: Soft , nontender , nondistended. Firm to palpation in both
0 lower quadrants in area of lower midline scar. Extremities:
0 Tenderness to palpation in bilateral lower extremities which was
0 diffuse and nonspecific. Peripheral pulses revealed 1 plus
0 dorsalis pedis pulse and 1 plus posterior tibial pulse on right
0 lower extremity and 2 plus dorsalis pedis pulse and 2 plus
0 posterior tibial pulse on left lower extremity with 1 plus edema
0 bilaterally. Neurologic: The patient was conscious and alert and
0 oriented times three with no deficits.
1 LABORATORY DATA: Sodium 140 , potassium 4.7 , BUN 18 , creatinine
1 1.0 , glucose 205. WBC 12 , hematocrit 37 , INR
0 0.1. ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave
1 changes.
1 MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg q.d. , Atenolol 125 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
1 Captopril 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Colace , Axid 150 mg
1 p.o. b.i.d. , Amlodipine 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Imdur 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. ,
1 and insulin NPH 22 units q.a.m. and regular 10 units q.a.m.
0 ALLERGIES: Penicillin- rash.
0 HOSPITAL COURSE: On 1/30/99 the patient was brought to the
0 operating room and underwent a coronary artery
0 bypass graft times three with a left internal mammary artery to the
0 left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse
0 marginal and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
0 After surgery the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
0 Unit in stable condition. On postoperative day #1 the patient was
0 extubated without incident.
0 On postoperative day #2 the patient experienced a period of atrial
0 fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and rates in the
0 150s. The patient was treated with IV Lopressor and Diltiazem drip
0 at 10 mg/hr. The patient subsequently converted spontaneously to
0 normal sinus rhythm. Postoperatively the patient continued to
0 experience hypertension with systolic blood pressures ranging from
0 160s to 190s. The patient was started back on Lopressor and
0 Captopril and gradually increased to preoperative doses. The
1 patient was also started back on Amlodipine for further blood
0 pressure control. The patient continued to experience brief
0 episodes of atrial fibrillation with spontaneous conversion to
0 normal sinus rhythm. The patient was followed by her cardiologist
0 postoperatively , Dr. Grunow . The patient was started on
0 anticoagulation with Coumadin. The patient's atrial fibrillation
0 continued to decrease in frequency and duration and , at the time of
0 discharge , the patient had been in normal sinus rhythm for greater
0 than 24 hours. The patient was seen by physical therapy service
0 and it was felt that the patient would benefit from rehabilitation.
0 The patient is scheduled to be discharged on postoperative day #8
0 to rehabilitation facility in stable condition with all wounds
1 clean and dry.
1 On day of discharge her sodium is 137 , potassium 3.9 , BUN 16 ,
1 creatinine 0.9 , glucose 163. WBC 16.7 , hematocrit 31 , platelet
1 count 340 , INR 2.3.
