TEST INFO:  All features removed except for the line distance feature. 

CONCLUSION:  The results on the bottom indicate (in this case) that 
             the distance of discharge meds from the lines can be 
             be removed.  The lack of precision of the previous tests when
             the line distance metric was removed corresponded to lines within
             the d/c list that were missed.   However, in this case they are surrounded
             by lines that were correctly identified.   Running a clustering alg.
             on these should identifiy the clusters properly.

0 Discharge Date: 3/13/2005
1 ATTENDING: WHITEY , OSWALDO MD
1 SERVICE: Et Sa Rill
0 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES: Acute and chronic renal failure and
0 congestive heart failure.
0 OTHER PROBLEMS AND DIAGNOSES CONSIDERED: Type 2 diabetes ,
0 hyperlipidemia , acute and chronic renal insufficiency , upper GI
0 bleed with gastritis , ischemic cardiomyopathy , gout , sacral
1 decubitus ulcer.
0 BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Slauson is a 60-year-old
0 man with a known history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and CHF , EF
1 of 35% , status post CABG in 1990 with redo in July 2005 , as well
0 as mitral and tricuspid valve repair and left atrial
0 reconstruction in July 2005. He presented asymptomatic from home
0 after being called by his primary cardiologist as the lab result
0 showed elevated BUN and creatinine at 244/4.1. This all occurred
0 in the setting of increased diuresis on torsemide , increasing the
1 dose from 100 mg by mouth twice daily to 150 mg by mouth twice
0 daily as well as a recent addition of Keflex for sacral decubitus
0 ulcer. On further questioning , Mr. Satoe reported symptoms of
0 increasing dyspnea on exertion with decreased exercise tolerance
0 as well as chronic loose stools with a history of C-diff
0 positivity but negative on last testing. He denied any chest
1 pain , pleurisy , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and both he and
0 his family denied any change in mental status as well as
0 hematuria or dysuria , although he did complain of mild urinary
0 hesitancy. Prior to presentation , he was directed to hold his
0 diuretics , included torsemide as well as all other nephrotoxic
0 agents including allopurinol , colchicine , digoxin , and
0 lisinopril.
0 His allergies include heparin to which he has heparin-induced
0 thrombocytopenia.
0 In terms of medication reactions during this hospitalization , he
1 was placed on H. pylori treatment with amoxicillin ,
1 clarithromycin , and Nexium twice daily; and in reaction to this ,
0 he had mild elevation of his liver function tests.
1 BRIEF ADMISSION PHYSICAL: Mr. Blackmer is A&amp;O x3 with a BP of
1 90/60 , heart rate of 84. His lungs are bilaterally clear. His
1 heart exam shows a regular S1 , S2. Faint S3 with a 1/6
1 holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex with a JVD of 12 cm
1 plus V waves. His abdomen is benign. Extremities show no edema ,
0 but a left lower extremity petechial rash. He is found to be
1 heme positive with tarry stool , and he has a stable stage 4
0 sacral decubitus ulcer , well granulated without clear evidence of
0 infection.
1 Admission labs are significant for creatinine of 3.6 , BUN of 239 ,
1 potassium of 5.8 , digoxin of 1.7 , hematocrit of 29.3 , INR 4.1.
0 Admission EKG showed sinus rhythm with a first degree AV block.
1 Stable Q's in II , III , aVF , as well as V4 to V6. Left axis
0 deviation and right bundle branch block and an unchanged ST
1 depression in V2.
0 OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES: 9/12/2005 , right heart
0 catheterization with PA line removal on 2/2/2005. 9/0/2005 ,
0 upper endoscopy and colonoscopy. 4/17/2005 , echocardiogram.
0 4/17/2005 , renal ultrasound.
0 HOSPPITAL COURSE:
0 1. Mr. Kristin presented with acute and chronic renal failure
0 with baseline BUN and creatinine at approximately 66/2.4 with a
0 rapid rise between presentation and the last noted value on
0 9/24/2005. Although , he was asymptomatic and did not have any
0 EKG changes , he was treated with Kayexalate and sodium
0 bicarbonate which resulted in rapid normalization of potassium.
0 The superelevation of his BUN was thought in part to be due to
0 possible over diuresis but also complicated by the fact that he
0 had Hemoccult positive stool as suspicious for a GI bleed as a
0 source of increased nitrogen. The renal service was consulted
0 and initial treatment of his acute renal failure included the
0 above plus removal of all fluid restriction and diuresis in order
0 to reverse any potential prerenal state. Essentially , all urine
0 and renal studies including eosinophils and renal ultrasound were
0 negative with a renal ultrasound showing normal kidneys without
0 hydronephrosis but without increased resistance in the feet
0 bilaterally. At the time of discharge , his creatinine and BUN
0 had fallen to 1.9/81 respectively and remained stable over days.
0 The initial renal diet restrictions imposed during the
0 hospitalization were removed towards the end of the stay with
0 persistently stable values as well.
0 2. From a cardiovascular standpoint , a repeat echo on 2/25
0 showed an EF of 35 to 40 with inferior wall and inferior septal
0 severe hypo to akinesis as well as posterior wall severe
0 hypokinesis with trace aortic insufficiency , 1+ mitral valve
0 regurgitation , 2+ tricuspid valve regurgitation but normal left
0 ventricular size and thickness as well as normal right
0 ventricular size function. In order to better assess his filling
0 pressures and fluid status and attempt to optimize his renal
1 function , Mr. Marthaler underwent a right heart cath with PA line
0 placement on 9/12/2005 which revealed elevating filling
0 pressures including right atrium at 26 to 27 , right ventricle
1 65/13 , PA 64/32 , wedge 36. Pulmonary artery sat 39% , SVR 1568 ,
0 and pulmonary vascular resistance 221. His cardiac output and
0 index were both reduced. The PA line was left in for tailor
0 therapy , and he was initially placed on nesiritide drip at 0.005
1 as well as a Lasix drip with good urine output and increase in
0 his cardiac output and index and decrease in his elevated
0 systemic vascular resistance. On 2/17/2005 , the nesiritide drip
0 was discontinued and Lasix continued with the addition of
0 short-acting nitrates in the form of Isordil. Eventually , he was
0 transferred from the Lasix drip to torsemide reaching optimal
1 dose of 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. on 1/13/2005 , and further tailoring
1 with Imdur 30 and hydralazine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. for further
0 afterload reduction were preformed. Lisinopril previously used
0 on admission was continuously held given the recent acute renal
1 failure.
0 3. From an ischemic standpoint , there were no active issues
0 during the hospitalization. His beta blocker was reduced to 12.5
1 briefly , but his normal dose of 25 once a day was resumed prior
1 to discharge. In terms of his rate , it was well controlled on
0 the above regimen , but his rhythm showed frequent ectopy without
0 response to diuresis or beta blockade. He does have an ICD in
0 place which never fired during the course of the hospitalization.
0 Upon discharge , he was close to euvolemia with an approximate
1 discharge weight of 67.6 kg.
0 4. From a GI standpoint , his initial presentation included
0 heme-positive tarry stools with elevated BUN. He was seen by the
0 GI service and underwent a colonscopy and upper EGD which were
0 significant for gastritis without signs of active bleeding as
0 well as internal hemorrhoids. H. pylori serologies were
0 positive , and he was initially started on clarithromycin ,
1 amoxicillin , and Nexium b.i.d. , but this regimen was changed to
1 amoxicillin , Flagyl , and Nexium b.i.d. given an elevation of his
0 LFTs on the prior regimen. There was no overt GI bleeding , and
0 he tolerated the procedure without complication.
0 5. From a nutrition standpoint , Mr. Splatt was seen by a
0 nutrition specialist who confirmed suspicion of suboptimal
0 caloric intake meeting his total caloric needs about only 60% and
0 total protein needs are 85% despite labilization of his diet and
0 the addition of Megace. His nutritional goals were even more
0 important given his large stage 4 sacral decubitus ulcer with
0 poor healing since March 2005. Despite encouragement and the
0 addition of appetite stimulants with vitamin C , zinc , mineral ,
0 multivitamins , and the addition of supplements , he presently fell
0 short of his goals but refused other means of diet
0 supplementation including NG tube placement and PEG placement and
0 is determined to provide adequate p.o. intake by mouth. He and
0 his family met with a registered dietitian and understand the
0 importance of his caloric intakes.
1 6. From a musculoskeletal point of view , he has stage 4 sacral
0 decubitus ulcer which is followed by plastic surgery and
0 frequently debrided as an outpatient , Dr. Bastress and his team ,
0 followed the patient while inhouse , and it was treated as per
0 protocol with b.i.d. dressing changes with Panafil and wet-to-dry
0 dressings. Initially , he was started on Keflex for suspicion of
0 infection in the wound , and this was changed to vancomycin given
0 MRSA growth in the wound and further Klebsiella growth which was
0 treated with levofloxacin , but these were all discontinued on
0 2/17/2005 as per plastic recommendations given the high
0 probability colonization. It was also felt that these
0 antibiotics would provide appropriate coverage for the possible
0 right lower lobe infiltrate questioned on x-ray.
0 7. From an endocrinology standpoint , he has a history of diabetes
1 type 2 , and he was continued on his Lantus and NovoLog insulin
0 sliding scale with titration of optimal glucose control in order
0 to promote wound healing. He was followed by the diabetes
1 management team.
0 8. From rheumatologic standpoint , he has a history of gout , and
1 he was maintained on allopurinol , renal dosing , but colchicine
0 helps. On about 10/9/2005 , he developed symptoms of podagra ,
0 and a prednisone taper starting at 15 mg was started with quick
0 resolution of symptoms.
0 9. From hematologic standpoint , he has anemia baseline and takes
0 Procrit once a week as an outpatient. He received 1 unit of
0 packed red blood cell transfusion on 1/24 and maintained his
0 hematocrit throughout the remainder of the hospitalization. He
0 was also maintained on darbepoetin as an inpatient.
0 Laboratory data showed no evidence of hemolysis with a normal
0 haptoglobin and LDH , but evidence of decreased iron saturation.
0 He was started on iron supplementation , and his Coumadin was held
0 for the supratherapeutic levels on admission and optimize prior
0 to discharge.
0 PERTINENT EXAM ON DISCHARGE: Patient was afebrile with stable
0 vital signs. He did have decreased breath sounds at the right
0 base know to correspond with his small right basilar opacity with
0 atelectasis. Other than that , his heart exam remained unchanged
1 with a regular rhythm , S1 and S2 , S3 , with a 1/6 holosystolic
1 murmur at the apex. His JVD was 11 cm , and he had no peripheral
1 edema.
1 Discharge lab showed a creatinine of 1.9 with a BUN of 81 ,
1 potassium of 3.6 , hematocrit 32.1 , white blood cell count 9000.
1 His digoxin level was normal at 0.8 , and his INR was 3.
1 CONSULTATNTS: Dr. Bingaman from Ox Derd Peake , Dr. Crisan from GI , Dr.
0 Whidbee from plastic surgery , Armando Mishulovin from nutrition , as
0 well as the diabetic management service.
