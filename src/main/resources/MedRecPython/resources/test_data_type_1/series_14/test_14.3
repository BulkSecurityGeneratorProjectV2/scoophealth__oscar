TEST INFO:  All features except for line distance measurements.

CONCLUSIONS:  Clusters id'd as the admit meds and hte d/c meds.
              d/c meds contained some from the lab report from above it.
              Using a line distance metric/evlaution post clustering should 
              elimiate the extra list.  Clustering will also have to ignore a
              some clusters that are smaller, may be problematic.

0 FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
0 ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: The patient was in no
1 acute distress. HEENT: Revealed a JVP at 8 to 9 cm of water.
0 Benign oropharynx. Moist mucous membranes. Pulmonary: Showed
1 no wheezes , rhonchi , or crackles , and a clear exam to
0 auscultation in both lung fields. Cardiovascular: Regular rate
1 and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2. No murmur , rub , or gallop
0 was appreciated. Abdomen: She had positive bowel sounds. She
0 was nontender and nondistended , obese , but no suprapubic
0 tenderness. No hepatosplenomegaly. Extremities: There is no
0 cyanosis , clubbing , or edema appreciated. She had 1+ dorsalis
0 pedis pulses bilaterally.
0 LABORATORY DATA: Pertinent laboratory findings at the time of
0 admission include hematocrit of 36.3 , white count of 7.7 , and
1 platelets 317 , 000. Sodium 138 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 96 ,
1 bicarbonate 28 , BUN 102 , and creatinine 2.8. Glucose was 88.
0 Otherwise , she was not coagulopathic and normal liver function
1 tests , and a negative set of cardiac enzymes. Her EKG on
0 admission showed she was ventricularly paced at 54 beats per
0 minute and that her EKG was unchanged from her prior EKG from
1 July , 2005.
0 HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS:
1 1. Cardiovascular pump: Initially , the patient's Imdur and
0 labetalol were held out of concern for hypertension and poor
1 renal perfusion. However , on the hospital day #1 without IV
0 hydration and holding of her p.o. blood pressure medications.
0 Her creatinine returned towards baseline , value is 2.3. As such ,
1 the patient was restarted on her home Imdur on February ,
0 2005. However , her spironolactone continued to be held. In
1 addition , her torsemide was held. Her urine output was
1 monitored , revealed that she put out over 2 L on her second
0 hospital day. As such , the patient was started on home dose of
1 beta-blocker Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. daily on hospital day #2 as
1 well as once daily dosing of her torsemide 60 mg. The patient's
0 creatinine continued to improve. It was felt that the patient
0 was achieving good forward systolic flow and then her
0 hypertension was resolved with blood pressures ranging from the
1 130s to 150s on hospital day #2. However , over the course of
0 hospital admission , the patient was felt to be retaining fluid
1 with a weight of 99 kg , up from an admission weight of 97 kg. As
0 the patient had previous admissions for pulmonary edema and CHF
0 exacerbation , it was felt that the patient should be more
0 aggressively diuresed to prevent pulmonary edema. As such , the
1 patient restarted on her home torsemide 60 mg , however , continued
0 to gain weight and retained fluid. As such , the patient was
1 changed to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix 2 days prior to discharge
0 and was maintained on that dose achieving over 1 L of net
1 diureses on the 2 days prior to her discharge. She was
1 discharged on 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix and achieves good effect
0 and maintaining adequate blood pressure.
1 2. Ischemia: The patient continued her home Lipitor and aspirin
0 doses for known coronary artery disease. However , overnight , the
1 evening of November , 2005 , and the morning of February ,
0 2005 , she developed irritant anginal pain radiating to her jaw.
1 Imdur had been held at admission for concern of hypertension , but
0 was restarted for her anginal pain and she responded well. There
1 were no EKG changes for this event , and her cardiac enzymes ,
0 which were excessive , currently negative. She was maintained on
1 aspirin , Lipitor , Imdur and p.r.n. sublingual nitroglycerin for
0 the remainder of her admission. She had no further chest pain
1 events.
0 3. Rhythm and rate: The patient was ventricularly paced and
0 maintained on telemetry. She was continued on her amiodarone 200
0 mg p.o. daily over her hospital course and tolerated this with
1 good effect. She also continued her Coumadin at 1.5 mg p.o.
0 daily for known atrial fibrillation and achieved a therapeutic PT
0 at 2.8. The patient had no complications or events from her
0 rhythm or rate standpoint.
0 4. Renal: The patient's creatinine returned to baseline by
1 hospital day #3. It was felt that her acute and chronic renal
0 failure may have been related to poor p.o. intake prior to
0 admission and subsequent hypovolemia. The patient had no further
0 issues from a renal standpoint and did not require aggressive
1 hydration , taking good p.o. On June , 2005 , the patient
0 developed an episode of 10/10 left flank pain with associated
0 nausea , but no vomiting , lasting 30 minutes , which she reported
0 was due to known gallstone in the neck of her gallbladder ,
0 identified by a CT of the abdomen without contrast within the
0 past year and by ultrasound in 2004. However , given the
1 dislocation of the pain , it was felt that this also may be
1 related to renal colic and as such , a CT of the abdomen stone
0 protocol was obtained on June , 2005 , which showed no
0 evidence of a kidney stone , however , did demonstrate once again
0 gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. The patient responded
1 well to 30 mg p.o. codeine for pain control and had resolution of
1 her symptoms by November , 2005 , hospital day #3.
0 5. Gastrointestinal: The known biliary colic had resolved by
1 November , 2005. The patient was continued on p.r.n. codeine
1 p.o. 30 mg q.6h. and Tylenol 325 mg to 650 mg q.6h. p.r.n. The
0 patient did not require IV morphine , requesting not to use
0 narcotics , and had no further events of pain on her hospital
1 course.
0 6. Endocrine: The patient was initially started on her home
1 dose of NPH insulin 47 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. and
0 regular insulin sliding scale. The a.m. fingersticks were low ,
0 ranging from the 60s to the 70s as were her p.m. fingersticks.
0 This was felt to be due to decreased p.o. in the hospital
0 setting. As such , the diabetes service after consultation
1 recommended decreasing her NPH insulin dose to 35 units q.a.m.
1 and her p.m. insulin to 10 units q.p.m. The patient requested
0 minimal injections during her hospital course and at home. As
1 such , there was still preprandial insulin administered , as the
0 patient continued to express preference for twice daily
0 injections. The patient achieved goal fingersticks over her
1 hospital course and was discharged on regimen of NPH insulin. In
0 addition , a TSH was obtained during the hospital course which
1 showed a level of 19 , being elevated , as such her Synthroid was
1 increased to 150 mcg daily. She will follow up with her
0 endocrinologist to repeat her TSH and hemoglobin A1c.
0 7. Fluids , Electrolytes , Nutrition: The patient was restarted
1 on her K-Dur 40 mEq q.a.m. and 20 mEq q.p.m. for potassium loss
0 secondary to diureses. Her electrolytes remained stable over
0 course of her hospital stay. She was continued on a
0 low-cholesterol low-fat diet and ADA diet.
1 8. Infectious Disease: The patient had a UA with 8 to 10 white
0 blood cells , concerning for possible low-grade UTI , especially
0 given her initial presenting symptoms. As such , she was started
0 on a 3-day course of Bactrim , and completed this course. She
0 remained afebrile over the course of her hospitalization and her
0 urine culture , which showed only 50 , 000 colony-forming units of
0 mixed flora , her white blood cell count remained within normal
0 limits over her hospital admission. As such , no further therapy
0 was required.
1 9. The patient was discharged home on March , 2005 , with
1 VNA services.
0 PLAN FOLLOWING DISCHARGE:
0 1. To have her endocrinologist follow up her hemoglobin A1c and
1 to repeat her TSH level to maximize her insulin regimen as well
1 as her Synthroid regimen.
1 2. To have followup with Dr. Polashek in the Coumadin Clinic to
0 maximize her Coumadin therapy and ensure that she is therapeutic.
0 MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
1 1. Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. daily.
1 2. Coumadin 1.5 mg p.o. daily.
1 3. Aspirin 81 p.o. daily.
1 4. Colchicine 0.6 mg p.o. q.o.d.
1 5. Insulin NPH 35 units q.a.m. and 10 units q.p.m.
1 6. Synthroid 150 mcg p.o. daily.
0 7. Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4-mg tablet 1 tablet every 5
1 minutes x3 days for p.r.n. chest pain.
1 8. Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o. daily.
