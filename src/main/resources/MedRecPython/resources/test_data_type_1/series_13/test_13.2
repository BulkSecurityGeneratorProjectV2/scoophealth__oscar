CONCLUSIONS:  Correctly found d/c med list.  Also found d/c instruction list.
              Will have to create a method that will evaluate the clumping 
              alg. work so that it takes the lists with the lowest number 
              of zero tagged lines.

0 Discharge Date: 5/12/2005
0 ATTENDING: CASTONGVAY , JERALD M.D.
0 ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
0 Change in mental status.
0 ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS:
0 Urinary tract infection , hypertension , diabetes , and coronary
0 artery disease.
0 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
0 This is an 83-year-old female with history of insulin-dependent
0 diabetes mellitus , hypertension , pulmonary carcinoid , and
0 coronary artery disease who presented with weakness and a change
0 in mental status. Her son found her at home on the floor. The
0 patient stated that she fell secondary to weakness. Her weakness
0 and change in mental status had lasted approximately one week.
0 She also complained of dysuria. No chest pain , no shortness of
0 breath , no nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea. At baseline , the
0 patient is alert and oriented x3. She lives alone and functions
0 independently. In the emergency room , a CAT scan of the head was
0 negative for acute process. Troponin was 0.2 , and therefore she
0 was started on IV heparin.
0 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:
0 Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 78 , blood pressure 190/82 ,
0 respiratory rate 18 , and oxygen 99% on room air. General: The
0 patient was in no acute distress , alert , and oriented only x1 to
0 person. HEENT: NC/AT. Neck: Supple. Cardiovascular: Normal
0 S1 , S2. Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs , rubs , or gallops.
0 Lungs were clear bilaterally. Abdomen was soft , nontender , and
0 nondistended , positive for bowel sounds. Extremities: No edema
0 or cyanosis: Neuro exam: Strength was equal bilaterally , but
0 weak 3/5 throughout. Sensation was intact throughout. Cranial
0 nerves III through XII were grossly intact.
0 LABORATORY DATA:
0 Labs on admission showed a white blood cell count of 12.3 ,
0 hematocrit was 36.4 , CK of 3499 , and troponin of 0.2. Her EKG
0 was normal sinus rhythm , new 1 mm ST depression in leads II , III ,
0 and aVF. Her chest x-ray showed right lower lobe mass , which was
0 unchanged from her previous x-ray. Her head CT was negative.
0 Urinalysis on admission showed too numerous to count white blood
0 cells , plus nitrates , and plus leukocyte esterase.
0 HOSPITAL COURSE:
0 This is an 83-year-old with diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and
0 medically managed b.i.d. who is admitted with change mental
0 status and fall secondary to weakness.
0 1. Infectious disease: The patient was found to have a UTI ,
0 which is likely the reason for confusion and weakness. She was
0 started on ciprofloxacin. Urine cultures were sent and grew
0 Klebsiella and Citrobacter , which were indeed sensitive to
0 ciprofloxacin and she was continued on the ciprofloxacin.
0 2. Cardiovascular: Ischemia. She had a troponin leak on
0 admission of 0.2. A B set of cardiac enzymes was negative for , the
0 troponin level was less than assay. The leak was most likely secondary to
0 demand ischemia in the setting of an infection. A C set of her cardiac enzymes
0 was negative as well. The heparin was therefore discontinued. The
0 patient does have a history of coronary artery disease , but is
0 not a candidate for catheterization per her primary care doctor's
0 notes. In-house , she was continued on aspirin , statin and a
0 beta-blocker , which was changed during her admission from
0 Lopressor to labetalol for alpha blocking activity as her blood
0 pressure remained high and blood pressure optimization was
0 attempted. Norvasc was also increased to 10 mg daily and
0 hydralazine was given p.r.n. for blood pressure greater than 140 ,
0 for which she received a few doses. She was also continued on
0 lisinopril and Diovan and she was monitored on telemetry. The
0 only event on telemetry being a short run of SVT.
0 3. Neurologic: The patient's change in mental status was likely
0 related to urinary tract infection. The head CT on admission was
0 negative. Her neuro exam was not suggestive of any focal
0 deficits. Her Detrol was held during the admission due to its
0 effect on mental status. Her weakness was likely due to
0 deconditioning. She was very weak and had trouble sitting at the
0 edge of the bed or transferring to a chair with physical therapy.
0 She was seen by physical therapy who recommended rehabilitation
0 and 24-hour supervision. The family refused transfer to a
0 Skilled Nursing Facility despite the recommendation and they
0 understood the concern and risks. They reportedly planned to
0 supervise the patient on their own , 24 hours everyday.
0 4. Endocrine: The patient has diabetes mellitus , her blood
0 sugars were low on admission. Originally , her NPH dose was cut
0 in half. Her blood sugars were monitored and remained quite low.
0 Therefore , her evening NPH was halved again to 5 units at
0 bedtime. Her appetite remained fair during the admission , but not
0 great.
0 5. Prophylaxis: She received Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.
0 CODE STATUS:
0 DNR/DNI was instituted after lengthy discussions with the
0 patient's family.

0 or pleural effusion. Head CT on 1/29/05 showed no acute
0 intracranial process and widespread degenerative disease of the
0 cervical spine. No evidence for fracture or dislocation. An EKG
0 on 5/13/05 had ventricular rate of 5 , a PR interval of 164 , QRS
0 duration of 78 , showed sinus bradycardia , left ventricular
0 hypertrophy with repolarization abnormality , ST and T-wave
0 abnormalities. When compared with EKG of 1/29/05 T-wave
