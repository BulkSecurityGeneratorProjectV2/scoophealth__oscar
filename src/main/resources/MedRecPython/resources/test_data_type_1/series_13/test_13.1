0 exam notable for a nonreactive right pupil. Jugular venous
0 pulsation was visible at approximately 8 cm. Heart exam revealed

0 systolic murmur heard at the left upper sternal border with no
0 radiation. Neck exam revealed jugular venous pulsations at
0 approximately 8 cm. Heart exam reveals regular rate and rhythm
0 with normal S1 , S2 and 2 out of 6 systolic murmur at the left
